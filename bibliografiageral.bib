This provided a generalization of the measure of mutual information based on Shannon's entropy (corresponding toalpha = 1). It was shown that the first-ordercal j-divergence is a convex function only when a is restricted to some range. We define higher order Jensen differences and show that they are convex functions only when the underlying entropy function is of degree two. A statistical application requiring the convexity of higher order Jensen differences is indicated.},

This new approach is developed for analytically modeling the amplitude distribution of ultrasound images based on the HTR distribution. HTR as a non-Gaussian distribution is basically the amplitude probability density function (PDF) of the complex isotropic symmetric $\alpha$-stable (S $\alpha$ S) distribution which appears in the envelope distribution of ultrasonic images. Analytic expression for HTR distribution is a momentous consideration in signal processing with stable random variables. Furthermore, we introduce a mixture ratio estimator based on the energy of amplitude PDF which contains both $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ parameters. For a quantitative assessment, we compare the accuracy and computational complexity of the proposed mixture with other approximations of HTR distribution through several numeral simulations on synthetic random samples. Experimental results obtained from the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) distance and Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence as the goodness-of-fit tests on real ultrasound images reveal the favor of the new mixture model.},

Heavy-tailed Rayleigh distribution is basically the amplitude PDF of bi-variate isotropic alpha-stable distribution which appears in the envelope distribution of impulsive interferences and SAR return signals. Closed-form expression for PDF is a serious consideration in signal processing with alpha-stable distribution. in this case, mixture approximation by means of Rayleigh and a generalization of Cauchy distribution is a simple but comprehensive approach. Several models try to give a model for the mixture ratio based on alpha. We propose two new methods for mixture ratio estimation based on both alpha and γ. Numerical results verify that the proposed mixture approximation is closer to the theoretical and empirical heavy-tailed Rayleigh distribution.},

We find that, not only does our formula fit the data better than the ACFs that arise from auto-regressive and fractionally-integrated models, but it also yields the correct shape of the ACF, thus explaining the lags with which macroeconomic variables evolve and the onset of seemingly-sudden turning points. This finding puts a premium on quick and decisive macroeconomic policy interventions at the first signs of a turning point, in contrast to gradualist approaches.},

A growing number of contributions achieved the thresholding value by maximizing some information theory functions such as entropies. The classical techniques search for the thresholding value by formulating the entropy upon the ordered image gray level distribution. This ordering step does not allow to converge enough to the entropy optimum. In this paper, we propose a novel tow-dimensional image segmentation approach based on the flexible representation of Tsallis and Renyi entropies and employing the Genetic Algorithm (GA). From the information theory point of view, the entropy is used here to measure the amount of information contained in the two-dimensional histogram of the image. The GA is then used to maximize the entropy in order to segment efficiently the image into object and background. The experimental results show that our approach maximizes efficiently the entropy and generates better image segmentation quality compared to the classical thresholding technique.},

  abstract  = {Abstract A new lifetime distribution with increasing-constant hazard rate is introduced. It arises by compounding the Poisson and half-logistic distributions and can be applied in complementary risk models and parallel systems. Properties of the new distribution are discussed. Based on progressive type-II censoring, maximum likelihood estimates of the involved parameters are obtained and their properties are studied via a simulation study. Prediction of future order statistics is investigated using one- and two-sample Bayesian prediction schemes. Prediction intervals are also constructed using the highest conditional density. The coverage probabilities of the prediction intervals are computed. Finally, two examples are presented, one of them is based on simulated data and the other one is based on real data, to illustrate the obtained results. },

  abstract  = {This paper examines the mean-reverting property of real exchange rates. Earlier studies have generally not been able to reject the null hypothesis of a unit-root in real exchange rates, especially for the post-Bretton Woods floating period. The results imply that long-run purchasing power parity does not hold. More recent studies, especially those using panel unit-root tests, have found more favorable results, however. But, Karlsson and Loethgren (2000) and others have recently pointed out several potential pitfalls of panel unit-root tests. Thus, the panel unit-root test results are suggestive, but they are far from conclusive. Moreover, consistent individual country time series evidence that supports long-run purchasing power parity continues to be scarce. in this paper, we test for long memory using Lo's (1991) modified rescaled range test, and the rescaled variance test of Giraitis, Kokoszka, Leipus, and Teyssiere (2003). Our testing procedure provides a non-parametric alternative to the parametric tests commonly used in this literature. Our data set consists of monthly observations from April 1973 to April 2001 of the G-7 countries in the OECD. Our two tests find conflicting results when we use U.S. dollar real exchange rates. However, when non-U.S. dollar real exchange rates are used, we find only two cases out of fifteen where the null hypothesis of an unit-root with short-term dependence can be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis of long-term dependence using the modified rescaled range test, and only one case when using the rescaled variance test. Our results therefore provide a contrast to the recent favorable panel unit-root test results.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

  abstract      = {The problem of identifiability of finite mixture of Burr type XII distributions is studied. A procedure is presented for finding maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of a mixture of two Burr type XII distributions, using classified and unclassified observations. Estimation of a nonlinear discriminant function on the basis of a small sample size is considered. Its performance is investigated by a series of simulation experiments. The simulations conducted for estimating a nonlinear discriminant function by maximum likelihood, on the basis of unclassified data drawn from a mixture of the underlying populations suggest that the error rate can be reduced by a substantial percentage for widely separated populations. Generally, the performance of the mixture discrimination procedure relative to the completely classified procedure, measured by total probabilities is good.},

The results are reported in terms of empirical distribution function (EDF) tests of goodness of fit, on both individual and regional flood series through the application of these distributions to a set of reasonably long annual maximum series for part of Scotland. Some reproductive properties of the LLG and GEV are also compared. in terms of four key properties the LLG performs better than the GEV, LN3 and P3 distributions and is thus commended for further analysis.},

When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure.

For texture descriptors, Hermite transform is considered. Hermite transform uses the Hermite filters which are formed by the product of Hermite polynomials with Gaussian function. Instead of using all Hermite filters, a filter selection process is adopted to obtain optimal filters. A feature image is constructed based on the magnitude of each filter response. A region smoothing procedure is employed for both the color components and the feature image in order to make the region smoother while preserving the edge information. To this end, weighted least square edge-preserving filtering is used. Comprehensive experiments were conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method, using the Berkeley segmentation dataset.},

To avoid the difficulty of teaching R and statistics at the same time, statistical methods are kept to a minimum. The text covers how to download and install R, import and manage data, elementary plotting, an introduction to functions, advanced plotting, and common beginner mistakes. This book contains everything you need to know to get started with R. “Its biggest advantage is that it aims only to teach R...It organizes R commands very efficiently, with much teaching guidance included. I would describe this book as being handy--it’s the kind of book that you want to keep in your jacket pocket or backpack all the time, ready for use, like a Swiss Army knife.” (Loveday Conquest, University of Washington) “Whilst several books focus on learning statistics in R..., the authors of this book fill a gap in the market by focusing on learning R whilst almost completely avoiding any statistical jargon...The fact that the authors have very extensive experience of teaching R to absolute beginners shines throughout.” (Mark Mainwaring, Lancaster University) “Exactly what is needed...This is great, nice work. I love the ecological/biological examples; they will be an enormous help.” (Andrew J. Tyne, University of Nebraska-Lincoln)},

This derivation follows from considerations of the relationship between static fatigue crack extension and the failure time of a certain specimen. The cumulative distribution function (cdf) of this new family is quite similar to the cdf of the half-normal distribution, and therefore this density is referred to as the generalized half-normal distribution (GHN). Furthermore, this GHN family is a special case of the three-parameter generalized gamma distribution. Even though the GHN distribution is a two-parameter distribution, the hazard rate function can form variety of shapes such as monotonically increasing, monotonically decreasing, and bathtub shapes. Some properties of this family are given, and examples are cited to compare with other commonly used failure time distributions such as Weibull, gamma, lognormal, and Birnbaum-Saunders.},

We provide a comprehensive account of the mathematical properties of the new distribution and various structural quantities are derived. We discuss maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters for uncensored and censored data. Two empirical applications of the new model to real data are presented for illustrative purposes.},

These formulae may be implemented in the GLIM program to compute bias-corrected maximum likelihood estimates to order n<sup>-1</sup>, where n is the sample size, with minimal effort by means of a supplementary weighted regression. For linear logistic models it is shown that the asymptotic bias vector of β̂ is almost collinear with β. The approximate formula β p/m<sub>+</sub> for the bias of betâ in logistic models, where p = dim(β) and m<sub>+</sub> = Σ m<sub>i</sub> is the sum of the binomial indices, is derived and checked numerically.},

It contains the Weibull, exponentiated exponential, exponentiated Weibull and beta exponential distributions as special sub-models. We demonstrate that the BW density can be expressed as a mixture of Weibull densities. We provide their moments and two closed-form expressions for their moment-generating function. We examine the asymptotic distributions of the extreme values. Explicit expressions are derived for the mean deviations, Bonferroni and Lorenz curves, reliability and two entropies. The density of the BW-order statistics is a mixture of Weibull densities and two closed-form expressions are derived for their moments. The estimation of the parameters is approached by two methods: moments and maximum likelihood. We compare the performances of the estimates obtained from both the methods by simulation. The expected information matrix is derived. For the first time, we introduce a log-BW regression model to analyse censored data. The usefulness of the BW distribution is illustrated in the analysis of three real data sets.},

The beauty and importance of the new distribution lies in its ability to model both monotone and non-monotone failure rates that are quite common in lifetime problems and reliability. The proposed distribution has a number of well-known lifetime distributions as special sub-models, such as the Weibull, extreme value, exponentiated Weibull, generalized Rayleigh and modified Weibull (MW) distributions, among others. We obtain quantile and generating functions, mean deviations, Bonferroni and Lorenz curves and reliability. We provide explicit expressions for the density function of the order statistics and their moments. For the first time, we define the log-Kumaraswamy MW regression model to analyse censored data. The method of maximum likelihood is used for estimating the model parameters and the observed information matrix is determined. Two applications illustrate the potentiality of the proposed distribution. },

The new family offers much more flexibility for modeling real data than these two generators and the Kumaraswamy family of distributions (Cordeiro \& de Castro, 2011). The extended fa\-mily provides reasonable parametric fits to real data in several areas because the additional shape parameters can control the skewness and kurtosis simultaneously, vary tail weights and provide more entropy for the generated distribution. For any given distribution, we can construct a wider distribution with three additional shape parameters which has much more flexibility than the original one. The family density function is a linear combination of exponentiated densities defined from the same baseline distribution. The proposed family also has tractable mathematical properties including moments, generating function, mean deviations and order statistics. The parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood and the observed information matrix is determined. The importance of the family is very well illustrated. By means of two real data sets we demonstrate that this family can give better fits than those ones using the McDonald, beta generalized and Kumaraswamy generalized classes of distributions.},

  abstract  = { Most empirical studies on price setting that use micro data focus on advanced industrial countries. in this paper we analyze the experience of an emerging economy, Slovakia, using a large micro-level dataset that accounts for a substantial part of the consumer price index (about 5 million observations). We find that market structure is an important determinant of pricing behavior. The effect of market structure on persistence of inflation results from two conflicting forces. Increased competition may reduce persistence by increasing the frequency of price changes. On the contrary, higher competition may increase persistence through inertial behaviour induced by the strategic complementarity among price setters. in our case study, we find that the latter effects dominate. Indeed, the dispersion of prices is higher while persistence is lower in the non-tradable sectors, suggesting that higher competition is not conducive to lower persistence. Furthermore, we find that the frequency of price changes depends negatively on the price dispersion and positively on the product-specific inflation. These results seem consistent with predictions of Calvo's staggered price model. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The novelty of the paper is the analysis of a country characterized by nearly double-digit inflation and undergoing massive changes in market structure during the process of transition and accession to the EU. Several empirical findings stand out. Similarly to results on advanced market economies, we find that price changes are infrequent and sizeable. Moreover, the relationship between frequency and size of price changes is highly non-linear. Product-specific inflation is typically highly persistent. We find that market structure is an important determinant of pricing behaviour. The dispersion of prices is higher while persistence is lower in the non-tradable sectors, suggesting that higher competition in goods markets is not conducive to lower persistence. An important implication is that increasing market competition brought about by entry in the EU will not necessarily lead to lower persistence. By contrast, the increasing share of services in consumption will reduce persistence. Our results, together with the finding that the frequency of price changes depends negatively on the price dispersion and positively on the individual inflation, seems consistent with predictions of Calvo’s staggered price model.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents the comparison of two probability distributions with specific parameters for modelling asymmetry. Kum-normal and Azzalini's skew normal distributions were chosen because they turn, in special case, into the normal distribution. The quality of the fit, flexibility and amount of asymmetry parameters were factors used for comparison. Researches state that the Azzalini's skew normal distribution has limitations regarding the flexibility of the tail, presenting certain resistance in modelling asymmetry since, by increasing the absolute value of the asymmetry parameter, it tends to a emph{half}-normal distribution. The objectives of this study were to implement a kum-normal distribution and, using Monte Carlo simulation to generate data with increasing levels of asymmetry, choose the best fit. The distributions were also compared in modelling a beetle data set (emph{Tribolium cofusum}), grown at 29°C. For implementation we used the R package exttt{gamlss}, that allows adjusting of the models, simulating data of generalized distributions and obtaining the Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion and likelihood ratio test, used for comparison. The kum-normal distribution was better adjusted by increasing the level of asymmetry compared to Azzalini's skew normal distribution. For real data the two distributions do not differ significantly, showing equivalent estimation of the degree of asymmetry of these data.},

Theoretically, independent time series should be characterized by a Hurst exponent of 1/2. However, finite Brownian motion data sets will always give a value of the Hurst exponent larger than 1/2 and without an appropriate statistical test such a value can mistakenly be interpreted as evidence of long term memory. We obtain a more precise statistical significance test for the Hurst exponent and apply it to real financial data sets. Our empirical analysis shows no long-term memory in some financial returns, suggesting that Brownian motion cannot be rejected as a model for price dynamics.},

We present numerical results comparing the performance of these estimators for thirty-six different values of the parameter vector. Our results reveal that analytical bias corrections considerably outperform numerical bias corrections obtained from bootstrapping schemes. },

It is based on the assumption that the dependent variable is beta-distributed and that its mean is related to a set of regressors through a linear predictor with unknown coefficients and a link function. The model also includes a precision parameter which may be constant or depend on a (potentially different) set of regressors through a link function as well. This approach naturally incorporates features such as heteroskedasticity or skewness which are commonly observed in data taking values in the standard unit interval, such as rates or proportions. This paper describes the betareg package which provides the class of beta regressions in the R system for statistical computing. The underlying theory is briefly outlined, the implementation discussed and illustrated in various replication exercises.},

The combination of the non-linear structure with the long memory framework produces a model which is linear in parameters and therefore it permits the estimation of the deterministic terms by standard OLS-GLS methods. Moreover, the orthogonality property of Chebyshev’s polynomials makes them especially attractive to approximate non-linear structures of data. We present a procedure which allows us to test (possibly fractional) orders of integration at various frequencies in the presence of the Chebyshev trends with no effect on the standard limit distribution of the method. Several Monte Carlo experiments are conducted and the results indicate that the method performs well, and an empirical application, using data of real exchange rates is also carried out at the end of the article.},

Deterministic and stochastic seasonality is considered. For the latter case, we employ seasonal unit roots and seasonally fractionally integrated models. As a final approach, we also employ a model with possibly different orders of integration at zero and the seasonal frequencies. All these models are compared in terms of their forecasting ability in an out-of-sample experiment. The results in the paper show that a simple deterministic model with seasonal dummy variables and AR(1) disturbances produce better results than other approaches based on seasonal fractional and integer differentiation over short horizons. However, increasing the time horizon, the results cannot distinguish between the model based on seasonal dummies and another using fractional integration at zero and the seasonal frequencies.},

For this purpose, we examine the order of integration of the real GDP per capita series in these countries as well as their differences with respect to the US which is used as a benchmark country. We use both parametric and semiparametric methods and the results show that convergence is only achieved in half of the countries, namely, Austria, Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, Japan and the UK. On the contrary, the results for Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden show strong evidence against this hypothesis.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

The results show a significant structural break in 1998 for all model specifications and data periodicity. Furthermore, we do not find evidence of asymmetric adjustment of prices to dividends when using M-TAR and TAR models. The evidence of bubbles varies depending on the data periodicity and model specification used in the analysis. Finally, the results show persistent deviations of stock prices to dividends in all cases considered, though we only find evidence of bubbles in the Nasdaq index when using weekly data for the time period after June 1998.},

  abstract    = {The aim of this paper is to examine the relationship between the school performance and the wages of young Brazilians workers. We examine if school quality, measured by test scores of a generation in SAEB at the end of high school, affect the earnings of this generation when they enter the labor force, six years later. We use a pseudo-panel model to correct the problems of selection bias, created by migrations and by the high education level of the selected sample, through a Roy model (1951) applied in Dahl (2001). The determinants of school performance, like familiar background, school structure, teacher and director profiles also were analyzed. We conclude that in spite of school characteristics being responsible for a good performance of students in tests scores, what explains the differences of the earnings of young Brazilians workers is the school performance not explained by the model.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

Though the theoretical importance of the real interest rate has generated a sizable literature that examines its long-run properties, surprisingly, there does not exist any study that delves into this issue for South Africa. Given this, using quarterly data (1960:Q2-2010:Q4) for South Africa, our paper endeavors to analyze the long-run properties of the EPRR by using tests of unit root, cointegration, fractional integration and structural breaks. in addition, we also analyze whether monetary shocks contribute to fluctuations in the real interest rate based on test of structural breaks of the rate of inflation, as well as, Bayesian change point analysis. Based on the tests conducted, we conclude that the South African EPPR can be best viewed as a very persistent but ultimately mean-reverting process. Also, the persistence in the real interest rate can be tentatively considered as a monetary phenomenon.},

There can be substantial differences between the distributions of these two processes and of functionals derived from them, so that it becomes an important issue to decide which model to use as a basis for inference. Alternative methods for simulating the type I case are contrasted, and for models close to the nonstationarity boundary, truncating infinite sums is shown to result in a significant distortion of the distribution. A simple simulation method that overcomes this problem is described and implemented. The approach also has implications for the estimation of type I ARFIMA models, and a new conditional ML estimator is proposed, using the annual Nile minima series for illustration.},

  abstract    = {This paper analyses a class of nonlinear time series models exhibiting long memory. These processes exhibit short memory fluctuations around a local mean (regime) which switches randomly such that the durations of the regimes follow a power law. We show that if a large number of independent copies of such a process are aggregated, the resulting processes are Gaussian, have a linear representation, and converge after normalisation to fractional Brownian motion. Two cases arise, a stationary case in which the partial sums of the process converge, and a nonstationary case in which the process itself converges, the Hurst coefficient falling in the ranges ( 1 2 , 1) and (0, 1 2 ) respectively. However, a non-aggregated regime process is shown to converge to a Levy motion with infinite variance, suitably normalised, emphasising the fact that time aggregation alone fails to yield a FCLT. We comment on the relevance of our results to the interpretation of the long memory phenomenon, and also report some simulations aimed to throw light on the problem of discriminating between the models in practice. --<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

  abstract  = {We develop fractal methodology for data taking the form of surfaces. An advantage of fractal analysis is that it partitions roughness characteristics of a surface into a scale-free component (fractal dimension) and properties that depend purely on scale. Particular emphasis is given to anisotropy where we show that, for many surfaces, the fractal dimension of line transects across a surface must either be constant in every direction or be constant in each direction except one. This virtual direction invariance of fractal dimension provides another canonical feature of fractal analysis, complementing its scale invariance properties and enhancing its attractiveness as a method for summarizing properties of roughness. The dependence of roughness on direction may be explained in terms of scale rather than dimension and can vary with orientation. Scale may be described by a smooth periodic function and may be estimated nonparametrically. Our results and techniques are applied to analyse data on the surfaces of soil and plastic food wrapping. For the soil data, interest centres on the effect of surface roughness on retention of rain-water, and data are recorded as a series of digital images over time. Our analysis captures the way in which both the fractal dimension and the scale change with rainfall, or equivalently with time. The food wrapping data are on a much finer scale than the soil data and are particularly anisotropic. The analysis allows us to determine the manufacturing process which produces the smoothest wrapping, with least tendency for micro-organisms to adhere.},

The maximum likelihood equations are shown to be not unduly laborious to solve and the sampling properties of the resulting estimates are investigated, mainly by simulation. Moment estimators, minimum χ2 and Bayes estimators are discussed but they appear greatly inferior to maximum likelihood except in the univariate case, the inferiority lying either in the sampling properties of the estimates or in the complexity of the computation. The wider problems obtained by allowing the components in the mixture to have different covariance matrices, or by having more than two components in the mixture, are briefly discussed, as is the relevance of this problem to cluster analysis.},

The authors show that the response of inflation to output-gap or real exchange rate shocks varies considerably across the components, although the average response remains low; they also show that the average response has decreased over time. To forecast monthly inflation, the use of disaggregate data is a significant improvement over the use of aggregate data. However, the improvements in forecasts of quarterly rates of inflation are only minor. Overall, it remains difficult to properly model and forecast monthly core inflation in Canada.},

Fundamentally, Bitcoin returns are negatively associated with the EPU. However, the effect is positive and significant at both lower and higher quantiles of Bitcoin returns and the EPU. in the light of these findings, the paper concludes that Bitcoin can serve as a hedging tool against uncertainty. },

It is assumed that the data are coming either from log-normal or Weibull distributions and that they are Type-II censored. We use the difference of the maximized log-likelihood functions, in discriminating between the two distribution functions. We obtain the asymptotic distribution of the discrimination statistic. It is used to determine the probability of correct selection in this discrimination process. We perform some simulation studies to observe how the asymptotic results work for different sample sizes and for different censoring proportions. It is observed that the asymptotic results work quite well even for small sizes if the censoring proportions are not very low. We further suggest a modified discrimination procedure. Two real data sets are analysed for illustrative purposes. },

This is a difficult task because SAR images are contaminated with speckle noise. Different point estimation strategies under multiplicative noise are discussed in the literature. It is important to assess the quality of such point estimates and to also perform inference under a given confidence level. This can be achieved through interval parameter estimation. To that end, we propose bootstrap-based edge confidence interval. The relative merits of the different inference strategies are compared using Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that interval edge estimation can be used to assess the accuracy of an edge point estimate. They also show that interval estimates can be quite accurate and that they can indicate the absence of an edge. in order to illustrate interval edge estimation, we also analyze a real data set.},

We argue, in contrast, that they are intimately related, and we substantiate our claim in several environments, including a simple mixture model, Engle and Lee's (1999) stochastic permanent break model, and Hamilton's (1989) Markov switching model. in particular, we show analytically that stochastic regime switching is easily confused with long memory, even asymptotically, so long as only a small' amount of regime switching occurs, in a sense that we make precise.

  abstract  = {This paper considers a simple Continuous Beliefs System (CBS) toinvestigate the effects on price dynamics of several behavioralassumptions: (i) herd behaviour; (ii) a-synchronous updating ofbeliefs; and (iii) heterogeneity in time horizons (memory) amongagents. The recently introduced concept of a CBS allows one to model the co-evolution of prices and the beliefs distribution explicitly, while keeping track of the unpredictable nature of individual preferences (Diks and Van der Weide, 2003). As a benchmark model we take a simple CBS, which in a market withmany traders exhibits a random walk driven by news.Using the explicit nature of the dynamics of the CBS we show that the introduction of herding modifies the random walk to an ARIMA($0,1,1$) process, which is observationally equivalent to areduction of the number of market participants. in terms of returns the model predicts MA(1) structure with a negative coeffient. Asynchronous updating leads to an MA(1) model for returns with GARCH($1,1$) innovations, and predicts a relation between the ARCH and GARCH coefficients. Heterogeneity in memory leads to long-range dependence in returns. in the empirical section we perform a modest "reality check" concerning the predicted sign of the MA coefficient and the relation between the ARCH and GARCH coefficients for exchange rate data.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

  abstract  = {Time series displaying long-range correlations have been observed in numerous fields, such as biology, psychology, hydrology, and economics, among others. For rhythmic movements such as tapping tasks, the Wing–Kristofferson model offers {a de}composition of the inter-response intervals based on a cognitive component and on a motor component. It has been suggested that the cognitive component should be modeled as a long-memory process and the motor component should be treated as a white noise process. Some probabilistic explanations for long-range dependences have been proposed, such as the aggregation of short-memory processes, the renewal-reward processes, and the error-duration processes. A new approach to the Wing–Kristofferson model which provides insights into the origin of long memory based on regime-switching processes is proposed. Under some assumptions, the autocorrelation function and the spectral density function of the model are obtained. Furthermore, an estimator of the parameters based on the maximization of the frequency-domain representation of the likelihood function is proposed. A simulation study evaluating the sample properties of this estimator is performed. Finally, an experimental study involving tapping tasks with two target frequencies is presented.},

Plantations of maritime pines near Landes, France, range in age from 8 to 46 years with above-ground biomass between 5 and 105 tons/ha. Loblolly pine stands established on abandoned agricultural fields near Duke, NC, range in age from 4 to 90 years and extend the range of above-ground biomass to 560 tons/ha for the older stands. These two experimental forests are largely complementary with respect to biomass. Radar backscatter is found to increase approximately linearly with increasing biomass until it saturates at a biomass level that depends on the radar frequency. The biomass saturation level is about 200 tons/ha at P-band and 100 tons/ha at L-band, and the C-band backscattering coefficient shows much less sensitivity to total above-ground biomass},

  abstract      = {Starting from a recent paper by Murshed (Stoch Environ Res Risk Assess 25:897--911, 2011) in which a good performance of the Beta-k distribution in analyzing extreme hydrologic events is shown, in this paper, we propose the use of two new four-parameters distribution functions strongly related to the Beta-k distribution, namely the Beta-Dagum and the Beta-Singh-Maddala distributions. More in detail, the new distributions are a generalization of a reparametrization of Beta-k and Beta-p distributions, respectively. For these distributions some particular interpretations in terms of maximum and minimum of sequences of random variables can be derived and the maximal and minimal domain of attraction can be obtained. Moreover, the method of maximum likelihood, the method of moments and the method of L-moments are examined to estimate the parameters. Finally, two different applications on real data regarding maxima and minima of river flows are reported, in order to show the potentiality of these two models in the extreme events analysis.},

Our starting point is to demonstrate that the scale mixture of Gaussian (SMoG) distribution model is suitable for modeling PolSAR data. We show that the distribution of the sample covariance matrix for the SMoG model is given as a generalization of the Wishart distribution and present this expression in integral form. We then derive the closed-form solution for one particular SMoG distribution, which is known as the multivariate K-distribution. Based on this new distribution for the sample covariance matrix, termed as the K -Wishart distribution, we propose a Bayesian classification scheme, which can be used in both supervised and unsupervised modes. To demonstrate the effect of including non-Gaussianity, we present a detailed comparison with the standard Wishart classifier using airborne EMISAR data.},

  abstract      = {The paper considers a number of problems arising from the test of serial correlation based on the d statistic proposed earlier by the authors (Durbin & Watson, 1950, 1951). Methods of computing the exact distribution of d are investigated and the exact distribution is compared with six approximations to it for four sets of published data. It is found that approximations suggested by Theil and Nagar and by Hannan are too inaccurate for practical use but that the beta approximation proposed in the 1950 and 1951 papers and a new approximation, called by us the a + bd<sub>U</sub> approximation and based, like the beta approximation, on the exact first two moments of d, both perform well. The power of the d test is compared with that of certain exact tests proposed by Theil, Durbin, Koerts and Abrahamse from the standpoint of invariance theory. It is shown that the d test is locally most powerful invariant but that the other tests are not. There are three appendices. The first gives an account of the exact distribution of d. The second derives the mean and variance to a second order of approximation of a modified maximum likelihood statistic closely related to d. The third sets out details of the computations required for the a + bd<sub>U</sub> approximation.},

The different methods of estimation of parameters such as, weighted least squares and the maximum likelihood estimates of this distribution are studied. Finally, a real time data analysis is performed for this distribution and it is found that this class is more flexible class and it shown that the T EF distribution is much better fit for data’s originally fitted and analysed using Frˆechet or Exponentiated Frˆechet distribution.},

  abstract  = {The log-logistic distribution (LLD) is very useful in a wide variety of applications, especially in the analysis of survival data (O'Quigley and Struthers 1982; Bennett 1983; Cox and Snell 1989). The LLD is very similar in shape to the log-normal distribution, however it has the advantage of having simple algebraic expressions for its survivor and hazard functions and a closed form for its distribution function. It is therefore more convenient than the log-normal distribution in handling censored data. However, due to the symmetry of the log-logistic distribution, it may be inappropriate for modelling censored survival date, especially for the cases where the hazard rate is skewed or heavily tailed. in this article we present a generalization of the LLD and refer to this as the generalized log-logistic distribution (GLLD). The suggested GLLD reflects the skewness and the structure of the heavy tail and generally shows some improvement over the LLD. in addition, we generalize a result characterizing the log-logistic distribution given by Shoukri, Mian, and Tracy (1988) and introduce two characterization theorems of the GLLD.},

Independent non-informative types of priors are considered for the unknown parameters to develop the Bayes estimators and corresponding Bayes risks under a squared error loss function.

We applied the BDS test and two other nonlinear statistical techniques, the Markov chain, and time reversibility tests to characterize the exchange rate returns dynamics. The results from the BDS test provide strong evidence of nonlinear dependence on the British pound, the Singapore dollar, the South African rand, and the Swedish krone. The Markov chain test shows evidence of a non-random walk and positive serial dependence in all currencies except for the British pound, the Canadian dollar, and the Swiss franc. Lastly, evidence of time irreversible and asymmetric dynamic behavior is found in seven currencies with the exception of the Canadian dollar. The results indicate that the asymmetry in the Singapore dollar, the South African rand, and the Swiss franc is due to nonlinearity in the functional form as opposed to non-Gaussian innovations.},

Academic researchers have sought to fit the three major characteristics of foreign exchange volatility: intraday periodicity, autocorrelation and discontinuities in prices. Early research modeled the autocorrelation in daily and weekly squared foreign exchange returns with ARCH/GARCH models. Increased computing power and availability of high-frequency data allowed later researchers to improve volatility and jumps estimates. Researchers also found it useful to incorporate information about periodic volatility patterns and macroeconomic announcements in their calculations. This article details these volatility and jump estimation methods, compares those methods empirically and provides some suggestions for further research.},

We review the frequentist and Bayesian ideas underlying model selection, which serve as an introduction to the rest of this special issue on ‘All models are wrong...’, a workshop under the same name was held in March 2011 in Groningen to critically examined the field of statistical model selection methods over the past 40 years. We briefly introduce the philosophical debate that is concerned with model selection. We present the results of a questionnaire that was distributed under the participants of the workshop, showing that the field has not yet reached a comforting consensus and is still in full swing.},

  abstract  = {This research examines whether a long-run stationary equilibrium relationship holds between economic activity and the consumption of crude steel within the UK. Using the theory of fractionally integrated and cointegrated processes, and allowing for the possibility that the equilibrium path changes abruptly at occasional points in time, it is possible to determine if steel consumption and economic activity follow a common stochastic trend or whether the two series randomly drift apart over time. Evidence is found to support such a long term relationship. This result is at odds with the conclusions drawn by previous researchers in the area. The reason for this difference may be due to these researchers concentrating only on I(0) and I(1) specifications, without consideration of fractional possibilities and also to a failure to account for structural breaks in the equilibrium relationship. Such conclusions are made within the framework of the ARFIMA methodology that yields reliable inferences on the degree of fractional integration and cointegration. Critical values for fractional contegration with an ARFIMA model in the presence of structural breaks are also derived in this paper.},

The autocorrelation function decays roughly as a power law with an exponent of 0.6, corresponding to a Hurst exponent H = 0.7. This implies that the signs of future orders are quite predictable from the signs of past orders; all else being equal, this would suggest a very strong market inefficiency. We demonstrate, however, that fluctuations in order signs are compensated for by anti-correlated fluctuations in transaction size and liquidity, which are also long-memory processes that act to make the returns whiter. We show that some institutions display long-range memory and others don't.},

First, to what extent properly measured marginal costs affect inflation dynamics. Second, to what extent purely forward looking inflation can be reconciled with the data. in this paper, we show heterogeneity in the pricing behavior of firms, matters for both issues. If pricing is heterogeneous, estimations based on GMM techniques are flawed, to an extent that increases with the correlation between aggregate and disaggregate price dynamics. We use sectoral quarterly French data on prices and marginal costs to illustrate this possibility and quantify the magnitude and direction of the implied bias. Two results arise when the estimation accounts for the possibility of heterogeneity. First, marginal costs become substantially more important in affecting inflation dynamics (i.e. heterogeneity induces a negative bias in the response of aggregate inflation to marginal costs). Second, lagged inflation also becomes more important than previously reported using GMM techniques. We provide analytical expressions for the biases which arise when heterogeneity is not taken into account. It helps pinpoint the sources of the differences in results. These are relevant to our data, where they help explain the biases just described, but they also provide a toolkit with which to gauge the magnitude and direction of an aggregation bias in any disaggregated data.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we have introduced a new generalization of the Exponentiated Pareto-I distribution named as the Transmuted Exponentiated Pareto-I distribution. The new distribution can model data with increasing, decreasing or constant hazard rate. The suitability of the distribution in modeling breaking strength of materials is highlighted with real data sets. Furthermore, we have derived some properties of the distribution including characteristic function, mean deviations, information entropies and order statistics of the new distribution. The estimation of distribution parameters has been done using Maximum Likelihood method. Finally, we have provided application of the new proposed distribution using two real data sets. It has been observed that the new distribution works better than the Pareto-I, Exponentiated Pareto-I and the Transmuted Pareto-I distributions for both data sets.},

The proposed PDF expression is simple, accurate, and closed-form and thus can be conveniently used for general performance analysis in wireless communications. Simulation results are used to confirm the validity of the proposed PDF expression. The performance analysis of maximal-ratio combining (MRC) diversity system and cellular mobile radio system in wireless communications using the proposed PDF expression is also presented.},

  abstract      = {Estimating financial risk is a critical issue for banks and insurance companies. Recently, quantile estimation based on extreme value theory (EVT) has found a successful domain of application in such a context, outperforming other methods. Given a parametric model provided by EVT, a natural approach is maximum likelihood estimation. Although the resulting estimator is asymptotically efficient, often the number of observations available to estimate the parameters of the EVT models is too small to make the large sample property trustworthy. in this paper, we study a new estimator of the parameters, the maximum Lq-likelihood estimator (MLqE), introduced by Ferrari and Yang (Estimation of tail probability via the maximum Lq-likelihood method, Technical Report 659, School of Statistics, University of Minnesota, 2007 http//:www.stat.umn.edu/{\textasciitilde}dferrari/research/techrep659.pdf ). We show that the MLqE outperforms the standard MLE, when estimating tail probabilities and quantiles of the generalized extreme value (GEV) and the generalized Pareto (GP) distributions. First, we assess the relative efficiency between the MLqE and the MLE for various sample sizes, using Monte Carlo simulations. Second, we analyze the performance of the MLqE for extreme quantile estimation using real-world financial data. The MLqE is characterized by a distortion parameter q and extends the traditional log-likelihood maximization procedure. When q{\textrightarrow}1, the new estimator approaches the traditional maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), recovering its desirable asymptotic properties; when q{\thinspace}≠{\thinspace}1 and the sample size is moderate or small, the MLqE successfully trades bias for variance, resulting in an overall gain in terms of accuracy (mean squared error).},

The proposed model is useful for situations where the variable of interest is continuous and restricted to the interval (0, 1) and is related to other variables through a regression structure. The regression parameters of the beta regression model are interpretable in terms of the mean of the response and, when the logit link is used, of an odds ratio, unlike the parameters of a linear regression that employs a transformed response. Estimation is performed by maximum likelihood. We provide closed-form expressions for the score function, for Fisher's information matrix and its inverse. Hypothesis testing is performed using approximations obtained from the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator. Some diagnostic measures are introduced. Finally, practical applications that employ real data are presented and discussed.},

The new class of distributions includes the Box-Cox t, Box-Cox Cole-Green, Box-Cox power exponential distributions, and the class of the log-symmetric distributions as special cases. It provides easy parameter interpretation, which makes it convenient for regression modeling purposes. Additionally, it provides enough flexibility to handle outliers. The usefulness of the Box-Cox symmetric models is illustrated in a series of applications to nutritional data.},

The objective is to investigate the radar sensitivity to woody biomass and some geometrical tree properties like branch dimensions and orientation. Model computations show that the backscatter coefficient is sensitive to the woody volume, particularly at HV polarization, P and L band; however, the radar response is appreciably influenced also by branch dimensions and orientation. Comparisons with experimental results available in the literature are shown. The correspondence between predicted and measured σ°s is generally good, although a slight overestimation is noted at L band, while uncertainties about data calibration and soil properties make the comparisons more difficult, in some cases, at P band},

Through inverse probability integral transformations we provide a constructive representation of skewed distributions, where the skewing mechanism and the original symmetric distributions are specified separately. We study the effects of the skewing mechanism on, e.g., modality, tail behavior and the amount of skewness generated. The representation is used to introduce novel classes of skewed distributions, where we induce certain prespecified characteristics through particular choices of the skewing mechanism. Finally, we use a Bayesian linear regression framework to compare the new classes with some existing distributions in the context of two empirical examples. },

Aspects regarding structural breaks and regime switches are discussed as well. To do that, the methods proposed by Hassler and Meller (2009) and Tsay and Härdle (2009) are used. The major results indicate that unemployment rates have two different levels of persistence. The first one is nonstationary whereas the second one is nonstationary but mean-reverting. Based on these findings, the convergence hypothesis of regional unemployment rates was tested. Following the fractional stochastic convergence criterion put forward by Mello and Guimaraes-Filho (2007), it was concluded that regional unemployment rates are convergent.},

  abstract  = { This article deals with the relationship between international trade and tourism. We focus on the effect that German tourism to Spain has on German imports of Spanish wine. Due to the different stochastic properties of the series under analysis, which display different orders of integration, a methodology is used based on long memory regression models, where tourism is supposed to be exogenous. The period covered is January 1998 to November 2004. The results show that tourism has an effect on wine imports that lasts between 2 and 9 months. Disaggregating the imports across the different types of wine, it is observed that only for red wines from Navarra, Penedus and Valdepenas, and to a certain extent for sparkling wine, tourism produces an effect on future import demand. From a policy-making perspective our results imply that the impact of tourism on the host economy is not only direct and short-term but also oblique and delayed, thus reinforcing the case for tourism as a means for economic development.},

Recently, Vaughan (2002) proposed another flexible generalization of the hyperbolic secant distribution which has a lot of nice properties but is not able to allow for skewness. For this reason, Fischer and Vaughan (2002) additionally introduced a skewness parameter by means of splitting the scale parameter and showed that most of the nice properties are preserved. We briefly review this class of distributions and apply them to financial return data. By means of the Nikkei225 data, it will be shown that this class of distributions, the so-called skew generalized secant hyperbolic distribution, provides an excellent fit in the context of unconditional and conditional return models.},

  abstract    = {The shape of a probability distribution is often summarized by the distribution's skewness and kurtosis. Starting from a symmetric parent density f on the real line, we can modify its shape (i.e. introduce skewness and in-/decrease kurtosis) if f is appropriately weighted. in particular, every density w on the interval (0; 1) is a specific weighting function. Within this work, we follow up a proposal of Jones (2004) and choose the Beta distribution as underlying weighting function w. Parent distributions like the Student-t, the logistic and the normal distribution have already been investigated in the literature. Based on the assumption that f is the density of a hyperbolic secant distribution, we introduce the Beta-hyperbolic secant (BHS) distribution. in contrast to the Beta-normal distribution and the to Beta-Student-t distribution, BHS densities are always unimodal and all moments exist. in contrast to the Beta-logistic distribution, the BHS distribution is more êexible regarding the range of skewness and leptokurtosis combinations. Moreover, we propose a generalization which nests both the Beta-logistic and the BHS distribution. Finally, the goodness-of-fit between all above-mentioned distributions is compared for glass fibre data and aluminium returns.},

  abstract    = {This paper presents the first empirical investigation of the Multifractal Model of Asset Returns (\&quot;MMAR\&quot;). The MMAR, developed in Mandelbrot, Fisher, and Calvet (1997), is an alternative to ARCH-type representations for modelling temporal heterogeneity in financial returns. Typically, researchers introduce temporal heterogeneity through time-varying conditional second moments in a discrete time framework. Multifractality introduces a new source of heterogeneity through time-varying local regularity in the price path. The concept of local Holder exponent describes local regularity. Multifractal processes bridge the gap between locally Gaussian (Ito) diffusions and jump-diffusions by allowing a multiplicity of Holder exponents. This paper investigates multifractality in Deutschemark/US Dollar currency exchange rates. After finding evidence of multifractal scaling, we show how to estimate the multifractal spectrum via the Legendre transform. The scaling laws found in the data are replicated in simulations. Further simulation experiments test whether alternative representations, such as FIGARCH, are likely to replicate the multifractal signature of the Deutschemark/US Dollar data. On the basis of this evidence, the MMAR hypothesis appears more likely. Overall, the MMAR is quite successful in uncovering a previously unseen empirical regularity. Additionally, the model generates realistic sample paths, and opens the door to new theoretical and applied approaches to asset pricing and risk valuation. We conclude by advocating further empirical study of multifractality in financial data, along with more intensive study of estimation techniques and inference procedures.},

One which has not been widely considered is the sech square distribution. This distribution has certain useful characteristics, such as simple Lorenz measures of inequality and a simple method of graphical analysis, which make it a useful tool in examining and comparing distributions of income. The differential equation from which the sech square distribution is derived can be varied to allow a wide range of different distribution forms to be fitted. A similarity exists between this distribution function and the Pareto and Champernowne distribution functions. Some of the characteristics of the latter distribution are discussed in the paper.},

  abstract    = {This paper quantifies the importance of heterogeneity in regional housing markets for the conduct of monetary policy using a new model called an aggregation VAR (AVAR). The model integrates a national financial market with regional housing markets, imposing all exact aggregation conditions. Monetary policy is transmitted to the real economy through the mortgage rate. The AVAR model is based on linear VARs, but its aggregate impulse responses exhibit two nonlinearities: (1) time variation stemming from aggregation over heterogeneous regions, and (2) state dependence on initial economic conditions in regions. Thus, the effect of monetary policy on the real economy depends on the extent and nature of regional heterogeneity, which vary over time. Using longitudinal data for detailed U.S. regions, we estimate the effects of time variation and state dependence on the dynamic responses of the AVAR model. These estimates, and aggregation bias, provide plausible and tangible explanations for \&quot;long and variable\&quot; lags in monetary policy. As an example, we show how the AVAR model can simulate the effects of coastal housing booms on the efficacy of monetary policy.},

Relationships between the derived measures and the parameters of the scaled Wishart law (i.e., the equivalent number of looks and the covariance matrix) are discussed. in addition, we obtain the asymptotic variances of the Shannon and Rényi entropy measurements when replacing distribution parameters by maximum-likelihood estimators. As a consequence, confidence intervals based on the Shannon and Rényi entropy measurements are also derived and proposed as new ways of capturing contrast. New hypothesis tests are additionally proposed using these results, and their performance is assessed using simulated and real data. in general terms, the test based on the Shannon entropy outperforms those based on Rényi entropy.},

Several classification strategies are compared in order to assess the importance of a careful statistical modeling of the data and the complementary nature of the information provided by different frequencies. Spatial context, which is relevant in order to obtain good results with noisy data, is described by means of the multiclass Potts model, and an iterated conditional modes classification algorithm that employs pseudolikelihood is proposed. The data are described using multivariate Gaussian laws and fully multilook polarimetric distributions arising from the multiplicative model. L-band, C-band, and both bands are used to assess the influence of dimensionality on the classification. Contextual and pointwise maximum-likelihood classifications are compared using real data. Results show that both context and number of frequencies contribute for better classification products, and that, a careful statistical description of the data leads to improved results.},

  abstract      = {This paper deals with numerical problems arising when performing maximum likelihood parameter estimation in speckled imagery using small samples. The noise that appears in images obtained with coherent illumination, as is the case of sonar, laser, ultrasound-B, and synthetic aperture radar, is called speckle, and it can neither be assumed Gaussian nor additive. The properties of speckle noise are well described by the multiplicative model, a statistical framework from which stem several important distributions. Amongst these distributions, one is regarded as the universal model for speckled data, namely, the law. This paper deals with amplitude data, so the distribution will be used. The literature reports that techniques for obtaining estimates (maximum likelihood, based on moments and on order statistics) of the parameters of the distribution require samples of hundreds, even thousands, of observations in order to obtain sensible values. This is verified for maximum likelihood estimation, and a proposal based on alternate optimization is made to alleviate this situation. The proposal is assessed with real and simulated data, showing that the convergence problems are no longer present. A Monte Carlo experiment is devised to estimate the quality of maximum likelihood estimators in small samples, and real data is successfully analyzed with the proposed alternated procedure. Stylized empirical influence functions are computed and used to choose a strategy for computing maximum likelihood estimates that is resistant to outliers.},

The expressiveness of the four analytic distances is assessed with respect to the variation of parameters. Such distances are then used for deriving new tests statistics, which are proved to have asymptotic chi-square distribution. Adopting the test size as a comparison criterion, a sensitivity study is performed by means of Monte Carlo experiments suggesting that the Bhattacharyya statistic outperforms all the others.

  abstract  = {Insights into the dynamics of a complex system are often gained by focusing on large fluctuations. For the financial system, huge databases now exist that facilitate the analysis of large fluctuations and the characterization of their statistical behaviour1,2. Power laws appear to describe histograms of relevant financial fluctuations, such as fluctuations in stock price, trading volume and the number of trades3–10. Surprisingly, the exponents that characterize these power laws are similar for different types and Sizes of markets, for different market trends and even for different countries - suggesting that a generic theoretical basis may underlie these phenomena. Here we propose a model, based on a plausible set of assumptions, which provides an explanation for these empirical power laws. Our model is based on the hypothesis that large movements in stock market activity arise from the trades of large participants. Starting from an empirical characterization of the size distribution of those large market participants (mutual funds), we show that the power laws observed in financial data arise when the trading behaviour is performed in an optimal way. Our model additionally explains certain striking empirical regularities that describe the relationship between large fluctuations in prices, trading volume and the number of trades.},

Although long memory models may capture some in-sample features of the data, when shifts occur in the series considered, their forecast performance is relatively poor, when compared with simple linear and Markov switching models. Moreover, our findings, in a more general framework, are in accordance with the works of Clements and Hendry (1998) and Clements and Krolzig (1998), reinforcing the idea that simple linear time series models remain useful tools for prediction.},

  abstract  = { Recently, Imbs, Mumtaz, Ravn and Rey (2005, hereinafter IMRR) have argued that much of the purchasing power parity (PPP) puzzle is due to upwardly biased estimates of persistence. According to them, the source of the bias is the existence of heterogeneous price adjustment dynamics at the sectoral level that established time series or panel data methods fail to control for. This paper re-examines this claim in two steps. Firstly, we demonstrate that IMRR's measures of sectoral persistence are systematically downwardly biased because they are based on an inaccurate definition of the 'average' impulse response function (IRF). We then show that standard estimates of shock persistence are recovered after this bias is corrected. Secondly, building on the results in Mayoral (2008), which prove that aggregate and micro models induce the same shock persistence behavior, we show that estimates based on aggregate and sectoral exchange rates are, in fact, highly consistent. Thus, aggregation is not the solution to the PPP puzzle. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = {The statistical properties of inflation and, in particular, its degree of persistence and stability over time is a subject of intense debate, and no consensus has been achieved yet. The goal of this paper is to analyze this controversy using a general approach, with the aim of providing a plausible explanation for the existing contradictory results. We consider the inflation rates of twenty-one OECD countries which are modeled as fractionally integrated (FI) processes. First, we show analytically that FI can appear in inflation rates after aggregating individual prices from firms that face different costs of adjusting their prices. Then, we provide robust empirical evidence supporting the FI hypothesis using both classical and Bayesian techniques. Next, we estimate impulse response functions and other scalar measures of persistence, achieving an accurate picture of this property and its variation across countries. It is shown that the application of some popular tools for measuring persistence, such as the sum of the AR coefficients, could lead to erroneous conclusions if fractional integration is present. Finally, we explore the existence of changes in inflation inertia using a novel approach. We conclude that the persistence of inflation is very high (although nonpermanent) in most postindustrial countries and that it has remained basically unchanged over the last four decades.},

  abstract    = {Since its first inception in the debate on the relationship between environment and growth in 1992, the Environmental Kuznets Curve has been subject to continuous and intense scrutiny. The literature can be roughly divided in two historical phases. Initially, after the seminal contributions, additional work aimed to extend the investigation to new pollutants and to verify the existence of an inverted-U shape as well as assessing the value of the turning point. The following phase focused instead on the robustness of the empirical relationship, particularly with respect to the omission of relevant explanatory variables other than GDP, alternative datasets, functional forms, and grouping of the countries examined. The most recent line of investigation criticizes the Environmental Kuznets Curve on more fundamental grounds, in that it stresses the lack of sufficient statistical testing of the empirical relationship and questions the very existence of the notion of Environmental Kuznets Curve. Attention is drawn in particular on the stationarity properties of the series involved – per capita emissions or concentrations and per capita GDP – and, in case of unit roots, on the cointegration property that must be present for the Environmental Kuznets Curve to be a well-defined concept. Only at that point can the researcher ask whether the long-run relationship exhibits an inverted-U pattern. On the basis of panel integration and cointegration tests for sulphur, Stern (2002, 2003) and Perman and Stern (1999, 2003) have presented evidence and forcefully stated that the Environmental Kuznets Curve does not exist. in this paper we ask whether similar strong conclusions can be arrived at when carrying out tests of fractional panel integration and cointegration. As an example we use the controversial case of carbon dioxide emissions. The results show that more EKCs come back into life relative to traditional integration/cointegration tests. However, we confirm that the EKC rem},

Most studies documenting asymmetric price transmission focus on nonlinear error correction processes, as opposed to the current study which analyses potential nonlinearities in the long-run relationship between the farm and retail prices. The null hypothesis of nonlinearity in the long-run relationship between farm and retail prices in the US hog/pork supply chain is rejected in favour of a Smooth Transition Cointegration (STC) framework. The STC framework predicts downward price stickiness in retail prices. The predicted residuals of the nonlinear model are used to investigate whether it is possible to disentangle nonlinearity in the long-run price relationship from nonlinearity in the adjustment towards the long-run equilibrium. The results underline the importance of testing for linearity in the long-run price relationship before modelling nonlinearity in short-run dynamics.},

For portfolios of illiquid securities, reported returns will tend to be smoother than true economic returns, which will understate volatility and increase risk-adjusted performance measures such as the Sharpe ratio. We propose an econometric model of illiquidity exposure and develop estimators for the smoothing profile as well as a smoothing-adjusted Sharpe ratio. For a sample of 908 hedge funds drawn from the TASS database, we show that our estimated smoothing coefficients vary considerably across hedge-fund style categories and may be a useful proxy for quantifying illiquidity exposure},

A new estimator of the long memory parameter in these models is proposed, based on the simple linear regression of the log periodogram on {a de}terministic regressor. The estimator is the ordinary least squares estimator of the slope parameter in this regression, formed using only the lowest frequency ordinates of the log periodogram. Its asymptotic distribution is derived, from which it is evident that the conventional interpretation of these least squares statistics is justified in large samples. Using synthetic data the asymptotic theory proves to be reliable in samples of 50 observations or more. For three postwar monthly economic time series, the estimated integrated series model provides more reliable out-of-sample forecasts than do more conventional procedures.},

It has been shown that compensation with an effective number of looks, rather than an intractable rederivation of the pdf, can account for the statistical dependence. This paper addresses the challenge of how to determine a suitable value for the effective number of looks. It is shown that an optimum value can be found via a maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) based on the interferometric phase pdf. However, since such an MLE is computationally intensive and numerically unstable, an estimator based on the method of moments (MoM) possessing similar fidelity is proposed. MoM is fast and robust and can be used in operational applications, such as determining constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection thresholds for moving-target detection in SAR along-track interferometry.},

Deterministic and stochastic seasonality is considered. For the latter case, we employ seasonal unit roots and seasonally fractionally integrated models. As a final approach, we also employ a model with possibly different orders of integration at zero and the seasonal frequencies. All these models are compared in terms of their forecasting ability in an out-of-sample experiment. The results in the paper show that a simple deterministic model with seasonal dummy variables and AR(1) disturbances produce better results than other approaches based on seasonal fractional and integer differentiation over short horizons. However, increasing the time horizon, the results cannot distinguish between the model based on seasonal dummies and another using fractional integration at zero and the seasonal frequencies.

Both long-memory and short-run coefficients are relevant for characterizing the changing patterns of U.S. macroeconomic dynamics. We provide an economic interpretation of those changes by examining the link between macroeconomic events and structural breaks.},

We implement a version of the tests of Robinson (1994a), which enables one to consider unit (or fractional) roots both at the zero (long-run) and at the cyclical frequencies. We examine the following series: inflation, real risk-free rate, real stock returns, equity premium and price/dividend ratio, annually from 1871 to 1993. When focusing exclusively on the long-run or zero frequency, the estimated order of integration varies considerably, but nonstationarity is found only for the price/dividend ratio. When the cyclical component is also taken into account, the series appear to be stationary but to exhibit long memory with respect to both components in almost all cases. The exception is the price/dividend ratio, whose order of integration is higher than 0.5 but smaller than 1 for the long-run frequency, and is constrained between 0 and 0.5 for the cyclical component. Also, mean reversion occurs in all cases. Finally, we use six different criteria to compare the forecasting performance of the fractional (at zero and cyclical) models with other based on fractional and integer differentiation exclusively at the zero frequency. The results show that the fractional cyclical model outperforms the others in a number of cases},

The daily re-alized volatility is equal to the sum of the squared intraday returns over a given day and thus uses intraday information to define an aggregated daily volatility measure. While the VaR specification based on an ARFIMAX(0,d,1)-skewed Student model for the daily realized volatility provides adequate one-day-ahead VaR forecasts, it does not really improve on the performance of a VaR model based on the skewed Student APARCH model and estimated using daily data. Thus, for the two financial assets considered in an univariate framework, both methods seem to be equivalent.

  abstract  = {Fractal behavior and long-range dependence have been observed in an astonishing number of physical, biological, geological, and socioeconomic systems. Time series, rofiles, and surfaces have been characterized by their fractal dimension, a measure of roughness, and by the Hurst coefficient, a measure of long-memory dependence. Both phenomena have been modeled and explained by self-affine random functions, such as fractional Gaussian noise and fractional Brownian motion. The assumption of statistical self-affinity implies a linear relationship between fractal dimension and Hurst coefficient and thereby links the two phenomena. This article introduces stochastic models that allow for any combination of fractal dimension and Hurst coefficient. Associated software for the synthesis of images with arbitrary, prespecified fractal properties and power-law correlations is available. The new models suggest a test for self-affinity that assesses coupling and decoupling of local and global behavior.},

  abstract  = {We test for departures from normal and independent and identically distributed (NIID) log returns, for log returns under the alternative hypothesis that are self-affine and either long-range dependent, or drawn randomly from an L-stable distribution with infinite higher-order moments. The finite sample performance of estimators of the two forms of self-affinity is explored in a simulation study. in contrast to rescaled range analysis and other conventional estimation methods, the variant of fluctuation analysis that considers finite sample moments only is able to identify both forms of self-affinity. When log returns are self-affine and long-range dependent under the alternative hypothesis, however, rescaled range analysis has higher power than fluctuation analysis. The techniques are illustrated by means of an analysis of the daily log returns for the indices of 11 stock markets of developed countries. Several of the smaller stock markets by capitalization exhibit evidence of long-range dependence in log returns.},

Our algorithm can be applied to Hurst exponent estimation for fractals with two or more dimensions. To assess the efficiency of this algorithm, we compare its calculation results to those of the well-known Hurst exponent estimation detrending moving average analysis algorithm. in this paper, the computation of the Hurst exponent has been performed for two-dimensional domains of various sizes, which were generated by the Cholesky–Levinson factorization algorithm. The surrogate surfaces have Hurst exponents of H = 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9. It has been established that the detrending moving average analysis algorithm is more sensitive to high-frequency components, while the stabilogram diffusion analysis tends to be sensitive to low-frequency components.},

When such a procedure is applied to the estimation of the parameters of the first order moments, it is possible to prove a necessary and sufficient condition for its consistency. Asymptotic normality is shown as well as the existence of a lower bound for the asymptotic covariance matrix. It is also seen that this bound can be reached if consistent estimates are available for the parameters of the second order moments. Finally, a necessary and sufficient condition for the consistency if the pseudo maximum likelihood estimation of the first and second moments is given.},

  abstract  = {Saddlepoint approximations are powerful tools for obtaining accurate expressions for densities and distribution functions. We give an elementary motivation and explanation of approximation techniques, starting with Taylor series expansions and progressing to the Laplace approximation of integrals. These approximations are illustrated with examples of the convolution of simple densities. We then turn to the saddlepoint approximation and, using both the Fourier inversion formula and Edgeworth expansions, we derive the saddlepoint approximation to the density of a single random variable. We next approximate the density of the sample mean of iid random variables, and also demonstrate the technique for approximating the density of a maximum likelihood estimator in exponential families.},

  abstract  = {We investigate in this paper the one-point statistical properties of the backscattered power derived by polarization synthesis of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations. in particular, we focus our attention on the normalized second moment of intensity and its dependency on the polarization state. For the analysis of this dependency, a novel graphical representation - an extension of the polarization response - is introduced: the polarimetric texture signature. The second moment of backscattered power characterizes statistically the variation of the radar signal due to speckle and the underlying radar cross section. The classical texture product model with a scalar radar reflectivity implies that the normalized second moment of intensity does not depend on the polarization state. However, such dependency is found in experimental observations, a fact that calls for further investigation of the phenomenon. Considering at first speckle statistics for homogeneous areas having no texture, it is demonstrated that correlation among the single-look speckle patterns, which are added on an intensity basis in a multilook operation, is responsible for a weak polarization dependency of the normalized second moment. Concerning the textural properties, a new model is proposed - the mixture model - where it is assumed that polarimetrically diverse scattering mechanisms contribute to the total return from an ensemble of resolution elements. Numerical simulations are used to reconstruct the texture signatures according to the mixture model, starting from simple assumptions related to scattering processes from natural targets. It is found that the polarimetric texture signature can be an interesting discriminator of weak targets against clutter, when only polarimetric diversity and not radiometric diversity plays a role. The effects predicted by the theory are confirmed by experimental analysis of polarimetric data acquired by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory AIRSAR sensor. Finally a classification scheme based on the polarimetric texture signature is proposed.},

First, the scaling range for DFA is studied for uncorrelated data as a function of time series length L and the correlation coefficient of the linear regression R2 at various confidence levels. Next, a similar analysis for artificial short series of data with long-term memory is performed. in both cases the scaling range λ is found to change linearly—both with L and R2. We show how this dependence can be generalized to a simple unified model describing the relation λ=λ(L,R2,H) where H (1/2≤H≤1) stands for the Hurst exponent of the long range autocorrelated signal. Our findings should be useful in all applications of DFA technique, particularly for instantaneous (local) DFA where a huge number of short time series has to be analyzed at the same time, without possibility of checking the scaling range in each of them separately.},

  abstract    = {Price gap, defined as the logarithmic price difference between the first two occupied price levels on the same side of a limit order book (LOB), is a key determinant of market depth, which is one of the dimensions of liquidity. However, the properties of price gaps have not been thoroughly studied due to the less availability of ultrahigh frequency data. in the paper, we rebuild the LOB dynamics based on the order flow data of 26 A-share stocks traded on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in 2003. Three key empirical statistical properties of price gaps are investigated. We find that the distribution of price gaps has a power-law tail for all stocks with an average tail exponent close to 3.2. Applying modern statistical methods, we confirm that the gap time series are long-range correlated and possess multifractal nature. These three features vary from stock to stock and are not universal. Furthermore, we also unveil buy-sell asymmetry phenomena in the properties of price gaps on the buy and sell sides of the LOBs for individual stocks. These findings deepen our understanding of the dynamics of liquidity of common stocks and can be used to calibrate agent-based computational financial models.},

It concerns Markov switching processes, Stopbreak models and SETAR processes. Then, new strategies are suggested to study locally these data sets. We propose first a test based on the k-the cumulants and mainly the construction of a meta-distribution based on copulas for the data set which will permit to take into account all the non-stationarities. This approach suggests that we can be able to do risk management for portfolio containing non stationary assets and also to obtain the distribution function of some specific models.},

It has been observed that there are some practical problems in estimating the skewness parameter for small to moderate sample sizes. in this paper we point out those problems and propose another skewed model which we call ``Power normal model''. The basic structural properties of the proposed model including its reliability properties are presented. The closeness of skew normal and power normal distributions is investigated. It is shown that the proposed model has some nice properties which make it feasible to study the estimation and testing of the skewness parameter. This can be achieved by transforming the data to the exponential model which has been studied extensively in the literature.},

Reliability 42, 299–302] introduced three-parameter exponentiated Weibull distribution. Two-parameter exponentiated exponential or generalized exponential distribution is a particular member of the exponentiated Weibull distribution. Generalized exponential distribution has a right skewed unimodal density function and monotone hazard function similar to the density functions and hazard functions of the gamma and Weibull distributions. It is observed that it can be used quite effectively to analyze lifetime data in place of gamma, Weibull and log-normal distributions.

It is observed that many properties of this new family are quite similar to those of a Weibull or a gamma family, therefore this distribution can be used as a possible alternative to a Weibull or a gamma distribution. We present two real life data sets, where it is observed that in one data set exponentiated exponential distribution has a better fit compared to Weibull or gamma distribution and in the other data set Weibull has a better fit than exponentiated exponential or gamma distribution.

Both distributions have several desirable properties, and nice physical interpretations. Because of the scale and shape parameters, both have quite a bit of flexibility for analysing different types of lifetime data. They have increasing as well as decreasing hazard rate depending on the shape parameter. Unfortunately both distributions also have certain drawbacks. This paper considers a three-parameter distribution which is a particular case of the exponentiated Weibull distribution originally proposed by Mudholkar, Srivastava & Freimer (1995) when the location parameter is not present. The study examines different properties of this model and observes that this family has some interesting features which are quite similar to those of the gamma family and the Weibull family, and certain distinct properties also. It appears this model can be used as an alternative to the gamma model or the Weibull model in many situations. One dataset is provided where the three-parameter generalized exponential distribution fits better than the three-parameter Weibull distribution or the three-parameter gamma distribution.},

This new family has been recently introduced by Nadarajah and Haghighi (2011 [1]); it can be used as an alternative to the gamma, Weibull and exponentiated exponential distributions. The scale parameter of lifetime distribution at constant stress levels is assumed to be a log-linear function of the stress levels and a cumulative exposure model holds. For this model, the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of the parameters, as well as the Fisher information matrix, are derived. The asymptotic variance of the scale parameter at {a de}sign stress is adopted as an optimization objective and its expression formula is provided using the maximum likelihood method. A Monte Carlo simulation study is carried out to examine the performance of these methods. The asymptotic confidence intervals for the parameters and hypothesis test for the parameter of interest are constructed. },

  abstract  = {A regime dependent VAR model is suggested that allows long memory (fractional integration) in each of the observed regime states as well as the possibility of fractional cointegration. The model is motivated by the dynamics of electricity prices where the transmission of power is subject to occasional congestion periods. For a system of bilateral prices non-congestion means that electricity prices are identical whereas congestion makes prices depart. Hence, the joint price dynamics implies switching between a univariate price process under non-congestion and a bivariate price process under congestion. At the same time, it is an empirical regularity that electricity prices tend to show a high degree of long memory, and thus that prices may be fractionally cointegrated. Analysis of Nord Pool data shows that even though the prices are identical under non-congestion, the prices are not, in general, fractionally cointegrated in the congestion state. Hence, in most cases price convergence is a property following from regime switching rather than a conventional error correction mechanism. Finally, the suggested model is shown to deliver forecasts that are more precise compared to competing models.},

  abstract  = {Rescaled range analysis is one of the classical methods used for detecting and quantifying long-term dependence in time series. However, rescaled range analysis has been shown in several studies to give biased estimates of the Hurst exponent in finite samples. A new estimator based on a modified expression of the expected value of the rescaled range is proposed. A comparison of the modified estimator with other alternatives shows that the modified estimator offers a great improvement over the classical rescaled range estimator in terms of bias and root mean square error, which makes it comparable to some of the leading estimators. The application of the proposed modified rescaled range estimator to a group of temperature, rainfall, river flow, and tree-ring time series in the Midwest USA demonstrates the extent to which classical rescaled range analysis can give misleading results. Based on a statistical test of significance, the number of time series exhibiting the Hurst effect is reduced from 36 to only 11 out of 56 temperature series, and from 23 to 7 out of 60 rainfall series. On the other hand, the number of time series exhibiting the Hurst effect marginally increased from 8 to 9 out of 49 river flow series, and from 49 to 54 out of 88 tree-ring series.},

These two entropy methods are compared with the methods of moments (MOM), probability weighted moments (PWM) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). It is shown that PSEM yields the same quantiles as does MLE for discrete cases, while ENT is found comparable to the MOM and PWM. For shorter return periods (<10--30 years), quantiles (discharges) estimated by these four methods are in close agreement, but the differences amongst them grow as the return period increases. The error in quantiles computed using the four methods becomes larger for return periods greater than 10--30 years.},

  abstract    = {Empirical studies have shown that a large number of financial asset returns exhibit fat tails and are often characterized by volatility clustering and asymmetry. Also revealed as a stylized fact is Long memory or long range dependence in market volatility, with significant impact on pricing and forecasting of market volatility. The implication is that models that accomodate long memory hold the promise of improved long-run volatility forecast as well as accurate pricing of long-term contracts. On the other hand, recent focus is on whether long memory can affect the measurement of market risk in the context of Value-at- Risk (V aR). in this paper, we evaluate the Value-at-Risk (V aR) and Expected Shortfall (ESF) in financial markets under such conditions. We examine one equity portfolio, the British FTSE100 and three stocks of the German DAX index portfolio (Bayer, Siemens and Volkswagen). Classical V aR estimation methodology such as exponential moving average (EMA) as well as extension to cases where long memory is an inherent characteristics of the system are investigated. in particular, we estimate two long memory models, the Fractional Integrated Asymmetric Power-ARCH and the Hyperbolic-GARCH with different error distribution assumptions. Our results show that models that account for asymmetries in the volatility specifications as well as fractional integrated parametrization of the volatility process, perform better in predicting the one-step as well as five-step ahead V aR and ESF for short and long positions than short memory models. This suggests that for proper risk valuation of options, the degree of persistence should be investigated and appropriate models that incorporate the existence of such characteristic be taken into account.},

  abstract    = {The volatility implied by observed market prices as a function of the strike and time to maturity form an Implied Volatility Surface (IV S). Practical applications require reducing the dimension and characterize its dynamics through a small number of factors. Such dimension reduction is summarized by a Dynamic Semiparametric Factor Model (DSFM) that characterizes the IV S itself and their movements across time by a multivariate time series of factor loadings. This paper focuses on investigating long range dependence in the factor loadings series. Our result reveals that shocks to volatility persist for a very long time, affecting significantly stock prices. For appropriate representation of the series dynamics and the possibility of improved forecasting, we model the long memory in levels and absolute returns using the class of fractional integrated volatility models that provide flexible structure to capture the slow decaying autocorrelation function reasonably well.},

Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) has proven particularly useful, revealing that genetic variation, normal development, or disease can lead to differences in the scale-free amplitude modulation of oscillations. Furthermore, amplitude dynamics is remarkably independent of the time-averaged oscillation power, indicating that the DFA provides unique insights into the functional organization of neuronal systems. To facilitate understanding and encourage wider use of scaling analysis of neuronal oscillations, we provide a pedagogical explanation of the DFA algorithm and its underlying theory. Practical advice on applying DFA to oscillations is supported by MATLAB scripts from the Neurophysiological Biomarker Toolbox (NBT) and links to the NBT tutorial website http://www.nbtwiki.net/. Finally, we provide a brief overview of insights derived from the application of DFA to ongoing oscillations in health and disease, and discuss the putative relevance of criticality for understanding the mechanism underlying scale-free modulation of oscillations.},

A model is presented for the flow of patients through a geriatric department, which has analogies to models of drug flow in pharmacokinetics. The theoretical model explains why the empirical pattern of length of stay in the occupied beds fits a sum of two exponentials; conversely, the empirical distribution, obtained from the midnight bed state report, can be used to study the effect of various policy decisions on both immediate and future admission rates for the department, and shows the benefits of policies which reduce long-stay patient numbers by improving long-stay rehabilitation.},

The analysis has commonly been done offline with the signal being resident in memory in full length, and the processing carried out in several distinct passes. However, in many relevant applications, such as monitoring or forecasting, algorithms are needed to capture changes in the fractal measure real-time. Here we introduce real-time variants of the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) and the closely related Signal Summation Conversion (SSC) methods, which are suitable to estimate the fractal exponent in one pass. Compared to offline algorithms, the precision is the same, the memory requirement is significantly lower, and the execution time depends on the same factors but with different rates. Our tests show that dynamic changes in the fractal parameter can be efficiently detected. We demonstrate the applicability of our real-time methods on signals of cerebral hemodynamics acquired during open-heart surgery.},

We obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters by considering censored data and evaluate local influence on the estimates of the parameters by taking different perturbation schemes. Some global-influence measurements are also investigated. Further, for different parameter settings, sample sizes and censoring percentages, various simulations are performed. in addition, the empirical distribution of some modified residuals are displayed and compared with the standard normal distribution. These studies suggest that the residual analysis usually performed in normal linear regression models can be extended to a modified deviance residual in the proposed regression model applied to censored data. We demonstrate that our extended regression model is very useful to the analysis of real data and may give more realistic fits than other special regression models. },

  abstract  = {In interval-censored survival data, the event of interest is not observed exactly but is only known to occur within some time interval. Such data appear very frequently. in this paper, we are concerned only with parametric forms, and so a location-scale regression model based on the exponentiated Weibull distribution is proposed for modeling interval-censored data. We show that the proposed log-exponentiated Weibull regression model for interval-censored data represents a parametric family of models that include other regression models that are broadly used in lifetime data analysis. Assuming the use of interval-censored data, we employ a frequentist analysis, a jackknife estimator, a parametric bootstrap and a Bayesian analysis for the parameters of the proposed model. We derive the appropriate matrices for assessing local influences on the parameter estimates under different perturbation schemes and present some ways to assess global influences. Furthermore, for different parameter settings, sample sizes and censoring percentages, various simulations are performed; in addition, the empirical distribution of some modified residuals are displayed and compared with the standard normal distribution. These studies suggest that the residual analysis usually performed in normal linear regression models can be straightforwardly extended to a modified deviance residual in log-exponentiated Weibull regression models for interval-censored data.},

We develop a simple macroeconomic model that exhibits long-range dependence, a consequence of aggregation in the presence of real business cycles. We then derive the relation between properties of fractionally integrated macroeconomic time series and those of microeconomic data and discuss how fiscal policy may alter the stochastic behavior of the former. To implement these results empirically, we employ a test for fractionally integrated time series based on the Hurst-Mandelbrot rescaled range. This test, which is robust to short-term dependence, is applied to quarterly and annual real GNP to determine the sources and nature of long-term dependence in the business cycle..},

Then we apply both methods to quantify the cross-correlations of the generated series, whose theoretical values are already known to us. By comparing the results we obtained, we find that the performance of this new approach is comparable to DCCA with less calculating amounts; our method can also reduce the impact of trends; furthermore, DMCA (for background and forward moving average case) outperforms DCCA in more accurate estimation when the analyzed times series are short in length. To provide an example, we also apply this new method to the time series of the real-world data from Brent and WTI crude oil spot markets, to investigate the complex cross-market correlation between these commodity markets. in all, our method is another practical choice to detect the cross-correlation between two short period non-stationary time series, and has potential application to real world problems.},

We therefore chose China as the representative of the transition and emerging economies, and USA as the representative of developed ones. We attempt to find the answers to the following questions: (1) Are all those different markets multifractal? (2) What are the dynamical causes for multifractality in those markets (if any)? (3) Are the multifractality strengths in those markets of the transition and emerging economies weaker (or stronger) than those of the developed ones? To answer these questions, Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA) are applied to study some of the representative agricultural futures markets in China and USA, namely, wheat, soy meal, soybean and corn. Our results suggest that all the markets of China and USA exhibit multifractal properties except US soybean market, which is much closer to mono-fractal comparing with China’s soybean market. To investigate the sources of multifractality, shuffling and phase randomization procedures are applied to destroy the temporal correlations and non-Gaussian distributions respectively. We found that multifractality can be mainly attributed to the non-Gaussian probability distribution and secondarily to the nonlinear temporal correlation mechanism for all the markets, except US soybean and soy meal, which derives from some other unknown factors. Furthermore, the average of tau(q) are applied to obtain the multifractal spectra of the two markets as a whole. The results show that the width of the multifractal spectrum of US agricultural futures markets is significantly narrower than that of China’s.

To clarify their performance, we compare them by Monte Carlo simulations; we generate many time-series of a fractal Brownian motion, of a Weierstrass–Mandelbrot cosine fractal function and of a fractionally integrated process, whose theoretical Hurst exponents are known, to compare the Hurst exponents estimated by the three methods. To better understand their pragmatic performance, we further apply all of these methods empirically in real-world applications.

  abstract  = {Over 70 percent of the population of the world's developed countries live in urbanized areas. in developing countries migration to urban areas is continuing at an increasing rate. Detection and analysis of settlement patterns, estimating population, and monitoring population migration in a timely manner are requisite to accurately assess the impact of human activities on the environment. Monitoring urban land use change patterns is among the most critical information needs for future economic development planning, natural resource allocation, and environmental and ecosystem management. Previous research has demonstrated the potential of imaging radar systems in analyzing urban, population, and settlement phenomena. However, the variability and complexity within and between urban land use morphologies present a convoluted environment for analysis. Studies of vegetation, soils, geology, hydrology, and ice and snow have all received more attention and been the subject of considerably more widespread and in-depth radar research. Nevertheless, imaging radars offer some distinct advantages and opportunities for urban-based research. With the arrival of operational space imaging SAR systems, a review of the current status of applications of radar remote sensing in urban studies should be useful for focusing the authors' attention on this important area of radar research and identification of specific problems for in-depth analysis. This paper traces the history of imaging radar research for urban, settlement, and population analysis. It presents a status report on the applications of SAR in settlement detection, population estimation, assessment of the impact of human activities on the physical environment, mapping and analyzing urban land use patterns, and interpretation of socioeconomic characteristics. The demonstrated capabilities and limitations of past and current imaging radar systems with reference to these applications are described. Potential avenues of future research are addressed},

The positive relation between these moments and the order of integration suggests that the degree of fractional integration should decrease with a lower mean or variance.

As opposed to most papers in the parametric causality literature, we are interested in whether money ever \&quot;causes\&quot; (can ever be used to forecast) output, when causation occurs, and how (through which causal chains). Our tests are based on new recursive parametric characterizations of causality chains which help to distinguish between mere noncausation (the total absence of indirect causal routes) and causal neutralization, in which several causal routes exists that cancel each other out such that noncausation occurs. in many cases the recursive characterizations imply greatly simplified linear compound hypotheses for multi-step ahead causation, and permit Wald tests with the usual asymptotic ÷²-distribution. A simulation study demonstrates that a sequential test method does not generate the type of size distortions typically reported in the literature, and null rejection frequencies depend entirely on how we define the \&quot;null hypothesis\&quot; of non-causality (at which horizon, if any). Using monthly data employed in Stock and Watson (1989), and others, we demonstrate that while Friedman and Kuttner's (1993) result that detrended money growth fails to cause output one month ahead continues into the third quarter of 2003, a significant causal lag may exist through a variety of short-term interest rates: money appears to cause output after at least one month passes, although in some cases using recent data conflicting evidence suggests money may never cause output and be truly irrelevant in matters of real decisions.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Wavelet shrinkage is a standard technique for denoising natural images. Originally proposed for univariate shrinkage within the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) domain it has been made more effective through the use of (approximately) translationally invariant wavelet decompositions such as the Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT) and bivariate shrinkage. Techniques using the DT-CWT benefit from both (approximate) translational invariance and improved directionality. However, these techniques have used the real and imaginary components of the complex valued subband coefficients separately. The proposed work instead uses coefficient magnitudes to produce a novel bivariate shrinkage technique based on a heavy tailed bivariate distribution (of magnitudes) to provide a quantitative improvement in image denoising. The results were compared to state of the art non-local means denoising technique BM3D. The PSNR results for small amounts of noise were comparable and within a small range for larger amounts of noise. However, when using the perceptually based structural similarity metric (SSIM) our developed technique offers improved results across the range of noise inputs when compared to {BM3D} in many cases. Perceptually, the developed technique is able to retain a greater quantity of the high frequency elements of the input image compared to BM3D.},

The fractional differencing operator is defined as an infinite binomial series expansion in powers of the backward-shift operator. Fractionally differenced processes exhibit long-term persistence and antipersistence; the dependence between observations a long time span apart decays much more slowly with time span than is the case with the more commonly studied time series models. Long-term persistent processes have applications in economics and hydrology; compared to existing models of long-term persistence, the family of models introduced here offers much greater flexibility in the simultaneous modelling of the short-term and long-term behaviour of a time series.},

  abstract  = {Detrended fluctuation analysis ͑DFA͒ is a scaling analysis method used to estimate long-range power-law correlation exponents in noisy signals. Many noisy signals in real systems display trends, so that the scaling results obtained from the DFA method become difficult to analyze. We systematically study the effects of three types of trends — linear, periodic, and power-law trends, and offer examples where these trends are likely to occur in real data. We compare the difference between the scaling results for artificially generated correlated noise and correlated noise with a trend, and study how trends lead to the appearance of crossovers in the scaling behavior. We find that crossovers result from the competition between the scaling of the noise and the ‘‘apparent’’ scaling of the trend. We study how the characteristics of these crossovers depend on ͑i͒ the slope of the linear trend; ͑ii͒ the amplitude and period of the periodic trend; ͑iii͒ the amplitude and power of the power-law trend, and ͑iv͒ the length as well as the correlation properties of the noise. Surprisingly, we find that the crossovers in the scaling of noisy signals with trends also follow scaling laws—i.e., long-range power-law dependence of the position of the crossover on the parameters of the trends. We show that the DFA result of noise with a trend can be exactly determined by the superposition of the separate results of the DFA on the noise and on the trend, assuming that the noise and the trend are not correlated. If this superposition rule is not followed, this is an indication that the noise and the superposed trend are not independent, so that removing the trend could lead to changes in the correlation properties of the noise. in addition, we show how to use DFA appropriately to minimize the effects of trends, how to recognize if a crossover indicates indeed a transition from one type to a different type of underlying correlation, or if the crossover is due to a trend without any transition in the dynamical properties of the noise.},

Unbalanced cointegration refers to the situation where the integration orders of the observables are different, but their corresponding balanced versions (with equal integration orders after filtering) are cointegrated in the usual sense. Within this setting, the long run linkage between the observables is driven by both the cointegrating parameter and the difference between the integration orders of the observables, which we consider to be unknown. Our results reveal three noticeable features. First, superconsistent (faster than n-consistent) estimators of the difference between memory parameters are achievable. Next, the joint limiting distribution of the estimators of both parameters is singular, and, finally, a modified version of the “Type II” fractional Brownian motion arises in the limiting theory. A Monte Carlo experiment and the discussion of an economic example are included.},

  abstract      = { Despite much effort and significant progress in recent years, image segmentation remains a challenging problem in image processing, especially for the low contrast, noisy synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. This paper explores the segmentation of oil slicks using a partial differential equation (PDE)‐based level set method, which represents the slick surface as an implicit propagation interface. Starting from an initial estimation with priori information, the level set method creates a set of speed functions to detect the position of the propagation interface. Specifically, the image intensity gradient and the curvature flow are utilized together to determine the speed and direction of the propagation. This allows the front interface to propagate naturally with topological changes, significant protrusions and narrow regions, giving rise to stable and smooth boundaries that discriminate oil slicks from the surrounding water. As the speckles are removed concurrently while the front interface propagates, the pre‐filtering of noise is saved. The proposed method has been illustrated by experiments on oil slick segmentation using the ERS‐2 SAR images. Its advantages over the traditional image segmentation approaches have also been demonstrated. },

Suppose Y is an absolutely continuous random variable symmetric about 0 with probability density function f and cumulative distribution function F. If a random variable X satisfies X 2 = d Y 2 , then X is said to have a generalized skew distribution of F (or f). The generalized skew-Cauchy (GSC) distribution are considered and special examples of GSC distribution are presented. Some of these examples are generated from generalized skew-normal or generalized skew-t distributions.},

  abstract      = {The problem of comparing two different partitions of a finite set of objects reappears continually in the clustering literature. We begin by reviewing a well-known measure of partition correspondence often attributed to Rand (1971), discuss the issue of correcting this index for chance, and note that a recent normalization strategy developed by Morey and Agresti (1984) and adopted by others (e.g., Miligan and Cooper 1985) is based on an incorrect assumption. Then, the general problem of comparing partitions is approached indirectly by assessing the congruence of two proximity matrices using a simple cross-product measure. They are generated from corresponding partitions using various scoring rules. Special cases derivable include traditionally familiar statistics and/or ones tailored to weight certain object pairs differentially. Finally, we propose a measure based on the comparison of object triples having the advantage of a probabilistic interpretation in addition to being corrected for chance (i.e., assuming a constant value under a reasonable null hypothesis) and bounded between {\textpm}1.},

This allows us to separately estimate aggregate, sectoral, country-specific and regional components of price changes. We thereby provide an improved estimate of the sectoral factor in comparison with previous literature, which decomposes price changes into an aggregate and idiosyncratic component only, and interprets the latter as sectoral. We find that the sectoral component explains much less of the variation in sectoral regional inflation rates and exhibits much less volatility than previous findings for the US indicate. We further contribute to the literature on price setting by providing evidence that country- and region-specific factors play an important role in addition to the sector-specific factors. We conclude that sectoral price changes have a “geographical” dimension, that leads to new insights regarding the properties of sectoral price changes. JEL Classification: E31, C38, D4, F4},

We compare the most commonly implemented sample quantile definitions by writing them in a common notation and investigating their motivation and some of their properties. We argue that there is a need to adopt a standard definition for sample quantiles so that the same answers are produced by different packages and within each package. We conclude by recommending that the median-unbiased estimator be used because it has most of the desirable properties of a quantile estimator and can be defined independently of the underlying distribution.},

First, how can purely forward looking pricing account for the observed persistence in aggregate inflation. Second, price-setting responds to movements in marginal costs, which should therefore be the driving force to observed inflation dynamics. This is not always the case in typical estimations. in this paper, we show how heterogeneity in pricing behaviour is relevant to both questions. We detail the conditions under which imposing homogeneity results in overestimating a backward-looking component in (aggregate) inflation, and underestimating the importance of (aggregate) marginal costs for (aggregate) inflation. We provide intuition for the direction of these biases, and verify them in French data with information on prices and marginal costs at the industry level. We show that the apparent discrepancy in the estimated duration of nominal rigidities, as implied from aggregate or microeconomic data, can be fully attributable to a heterogeneity bias.},

  abstract  = {Two SAR and biomass data sets of forests with different canopy architectures were examined for commonalties regarding backscatter/biomass saturation. The SAR data were collected using the NASA/JPL AIRSAR at incidence angles between 40° and 50° for tropical broadleaf evergreen forests in Hawaii and coniferous forests in North America and Europe. Radar signal saturation limits with respect to biomass for both forest types were determined to be ≈100 tons/ha for P-band (0.44 GHz), ≈40 tons/ha for L-band (1.25 GHz), and ≈20 tons/ha for C-band (5.3 GHz). The effect of the saturation limits on making global biomass inventories with SAR sensors was assessed by comparing the biomass saturation limits to a global vegetation type and biomass data base. C-band can be used to measure biomass in biomes covering 25% of the world's total ice-free vegetated surface area accounting for 4% of Earth's store of terrestrial phytomass. L- and P-band can be used to measure biomass in biomes covering 37% and 62% of the total vegetated surface area accounting for 8% and 19% of Earth's pool of terrestrial phytomass respectively. Biomes occupying approximately 38% of Earth's vegetated surface area containing 81% of the estimated total terrestrial phytomass have biomass densities above the saturation limit of current SAR systems (>100 tons/ha for P-band). Since P-band radar systems cannot currently operate effectively from orbit, the use of SAR sensors for biomass surveys may be limited even further to the L-band threshold. Emphasis should be shifted toward using SAR to characterize forest regeneration and development up to the saturation limits shown in this article rather than attempting to measure biomass directly in heavy forests.

  abstract  = {Stand level forest canopy structure as measured by the size, density, and distribution of the stems, branches, and leaves may have a strong effect on SAR backscatter. This study used the Michigan Microwave Canopy Scattering model (MIMICS) and forest canopy biometric data from tropical and subtropical broadleaf forests to simulate a series of forest stands having equivalent above ground biomass while still exhibiting substantial structural differences. The model stands were made to represent a guide range of basic structural differences found in Earth's broadleaf forests. The radar response to these structural differences is shown for the NASA/JPL AIRSAR P-, L.-, and C-band quadpol. configuration at incidence angles of 20°, 40°, and 60°. Results for three sets of equal-biomass-forest-stands were generated: five structural types having a total above ground biomass of 5 kg/m2, three structural types at 15 kg/m2, and three structural types at 30 kg/m2. Simplified model input were used to reduce the number of geometric variables tested across the range of structural types. The potential effect that extreme structural differences might have on the biomass signal and saturation threshold was assessed. Results indicate that structure can have a considerable effect on the SAR return for forests with equivalent above ground biomass. Differences in backscatter of up to 18 dB were predicted for some bands and polarizations. A forest canopy structural descriptor derived from the vegetation surface area to volume ratio (SA/V), which is a measure of structural consolidation, appears to explain the differences in backscatter. in many vegetation stands structural consolidation is directly related to an increase in biomass during the “thinning phase” of forest succession. This structural effect may explain the good relationship between SAR backscatter and biomass in these cases},

  abstract  = {A texture segmentation algorithm inspired by the multichannel filtering theory for visual information processing in the early stages of the human visual system is presented. The channels are characterized by a bank of Gabor filters that nearly uniformly covers the spatial-frequency domain. A systematic filter selection scheme based on reconstruction of the input image from the filtered images is proposed. Texture features are obtained by subjecting each (selected) filtered image to a nonlinear transformation and computing a measure of energy in a window around each pixel. An unsupervised square-error clustering algorithm is then used to integrate the feature images and produce a segmentation. A simple procedure to incorporate spatial adjacency information in the clustering process is proposed. Experiments on images with natural textures as well as artificial textures with identical second and third-order statistics are reported. The algorithm appears to perform as predicted by preattentive texture discrimination by a human.<<ETX>>},

We further put forward a strict statistical test in the spirit of bootstrapping to verify the weak-form market efficiency hypothesis by employing the DMA (or DFA) exponent as the statistic. We verify the weak-form efficiency of the crude oil futures market when the whole period is considered. When we break the whole series into three sub-series separated by the outbreaks of the Gulf War and the Iraq War, our statistical tests uncover that only the Gulf War has the impact of reducing the efficiency of the crude oil market. If we split the whole time series into two sub-series based on the signing date of the North American Free Trade Agreement, we find that the market is inefficient in the sub-periods during which the Gulf War broke out. We also perform the same analysis on short time series in moving windows and find that the market is inefficient only when some turbulent events occur, such as the oil price crash in 1985, the Gulf war, and the oil price crash in 2008. Our analysis may offer a new understanding of the efficiency of the crude oil futures market and shed new lights on the investigation of the efficiency in other financial markets.},

The parameter estimation of the model is performed by the methods of maximum likelihood, least squares, weighted least squares and moments, which are compared via a Monte Carlo simulation study. A natural extension of the model is considered as well as an application to a real data set.},

  abstract  = {This paper investigates the implications of cross-country heterogeneity within the euro area for the design of optimal monetary policy. We build an optimization-based multicountry model (MCM) describing the euro area in which differences between structural parameters across countries are allowed. Using Bayesian techniques, we estimate the MCM and its areawide counterpart (AWM).We then question which model is the most appropriate for monetary policy purposes. Several results emerge. First, using an AWM induces relatively large and significant welfare losses. Second, this is not the use of a rule based on aggregated variables that is costly in terms of welfare, but rather the use of a suboptimal forecasting model. Third, allowing for habit on consumption has important implications for the dynamics of models, but taking into account differences in price indexation has more drastic effects on welfare losses.},

  abstract    = {We examine the reaction of daily bond prices to the release of government macroeconomic news. These news releases are of interest because they are released on periodic, preannounced dates and because they cause substantial bond market volatility. The news component of volatility is not positively autocorrelated on these dates, since the news is released at a specific moment in time. We find that (1) expected returns on the short end of the bond market are significantly higher on these announcement dates, and (2) the persistence pattern of daily volatility is quite different around these days.},

Kumaraswamy’s distribution has its genesis in terms of uniform order statistics, and has particularly straightforward distribution and quantile functions which do not depend on special functions (and hence afford very easy random variate generation). The distribution might, therefore, have a particular role when a quantile-based approach to statistical modelling is taken, and its tractability has appeal for pedagogical uses. To date, the distribution has seen only limited use and development in the hydrological literature.},

  abstract  = {Univariate continuous distributions are one of the fundamental components on which statistical modelling, ancient and modern, frequentist and Bayesian, multi-dimensional and complex, is based. in this article, I review and compare some of the main general techniques for providing families of typically unimodal distributions on R with one or two, or possibly even three, shape parameters, controlling skewness and/or tailweight, in addition to their all-important location and scale parameters. One important and useful family is comprised of the ‘skew-symmetric’ distributions brought to prominence by Azzalini. As these are covered in considerable detail elsewhere in the literature, I focus more on their complements and competitors. Principal among these are distributions formed by transforming random variables, by what I call ‘transformation of scale’—including two-piece distributions—and by probability integral transformation of non-uniform random variables. I also treat briefly the issues of multi-variate extension, of distributions on subsets of R and of distributions on the circle. The review and comparison is not comprehensive, necessarily being selective and therefore somewhat personal. © 2014 The Authors.

  abstract  = {Consider starting from a symmetric distributionF on ℜ and generating a family of distributions from it by employing two parameters whose role is to introduce skewness and to vary tail weight. The proposal in this paper is a simple generalisation of the use of the collection of order statistic distributions associated withF for this purpose; an alternative derivation of this family of distributions is as the result of applying the inverse probability integral transformation to the beta distribution. General properties of the proposed family of distributions are explored. It is argued that two particular special cases are especially attractive because they appear to provide the most tractable instances of families with power and exponential tails; these are the skewt distribution and the logF distribution, respectively. Limited experience with fitting the distributions to data in their four-parameter form, with location and scale parameters added, is described, and hopes for their incorporation into complex modelling situations expressed. Extensions to the multivariate case and to ℜ+ are discussed, and links are forged between the distributions underlying the skewt and logF distributions and Tadikamalla and Johnson'sL U family.},

Jordan and Jacobs recently proposed an EM algorithm for the mixture of experts architecture of Jacobs, Jordan, Nowlan and Hinton (1991) and the hierarchical mixture of experts architecture of Jordan and Jacobs (1992). They showed empirically that the EM algorithm for these architectures yields significantly faster convergence than gradient ascent. In the current paper we provide a theoretical analysis of this algorithm. We show that the algorithm can be regarded as a variable metric algorithm with its searching direction having a positive projection on the gradient of the log likelihood. We also analyze the convergence of the algorithm and provide an explicit expression for the convergence rate. In addition, we describe an acceleration technique that yields a significant speedup in simulation experiments.},

Conversion of these to effective number of species is the key to a unified and intuitive interpretation of diversity. Effective numbers of species derived from standard diversity indices share a common set of intuitive mathematical properties and behave as one would expect of a diversity, while raw indices do not. Contrary to Keylock, the lack of concavity of effective numbers of species is irrelevant as long as they are used as transformations of concave alpha, beta, and gamma entropies. The practical importance of this transformation is demonstrated by applying it to a popular community similarity measure based on raw diversity indices or entropies. The standard similarity measure based on untransformed indices is shown to give misleading results, but transforming the indices or entropies to effective numbers of species produces a stable, easily interpreted, sensitive general similarity measure. General overlap measures derived from this transformed similarity measure yield the Jaccard index, Sørensen index, Horn index of overlap, and the Morisita–Horn index as special cases.},

  abstract  = {The K distribution has proven to be a promising and useful model for backscattering statistics in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. However, most studies to date have relied on a method of moments technique involving second and fourth moments to estimate the parameters of the K distribution. The variance of these parameter estimates is large in cases where the sample size is small and/or the true distribution of backscattered amplitude is highly non-Rayleigh. The present authors apply a maximum likelihood estimation method directly to the K distribution. They consider the situation for single-look SAR data as well as a simplified model for multilook data. They investigate the accuracy and uncertainties in maximum likelihood parameter estimates as functions of sample size and the parameters themselves. They also compare their results with those from a new method given by Raghavan (1991) and from a nonstandard method of moments technique; maximum likelihood parameter estimates prove to be at least as accurate as those from the other estimators in all cases tested, and are more accurate in most cases. Finally, they compare the simplified multilook model with nominally four-look SAR data acquired by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory AIRSAR over sea ice in the Beaufort Sea during March 1988. They find that the model fits data from both first-year and multiyear ice well and that backscattering statistics from each ice type are moderately non-Rayleigh. They note that the distributions for the data set differ too little between ice types to allow discrimination based on differing distribution parameters},

Estimation results of the negative binominal quasi maximum likelihood count data model confirm an inverse impact of lagged financial uncertainty on terrorism. Furthermore, empirical evidence leads to the conclusion of average lead time for terror incidents of 6 month. These results are potentially important for terror prevention.},

According to the empirical evidence gleaned from the two long-memory tests, we conclude that there exists significant evidence for the long-memory property in volatility in both the market index and in a majority of individual stocks. These findings indicate that the observed evidence of the long-memory feature in volatility of index series is not spurious, and that we can reject the hypothesis that spurious long-memory evidence in the volatility of index series is the consequence of contemporaneous aggregation. However, this conclusion should be considered cautiously, given that a considerable number of the individual stock volatilities in square returns strongly show a short-memory property, as the level of significance in statistical decisions is lowered to the 1\% level.},

The focus is given to the demonstration of the effectiveness and robustness of this region-based formulation compared to most common variational approaches. The main contributions of this global criterion are twofold. First, the proposed methods circumvent a major problem related to classical texture based segmentation approaches. Existing methods, even if they use different and various texture features, are mainly stated as the optimization of a criterion evaluating punctual pixel likelihoods or similarity measure computed within a local neighborhood. These approaches require sufficient dissimilarity between the considered texture features. An additional limitation is the choice of the neighborhood size and shape. These two parameters and especially the neighborhood size significantly influence the classification performances: the neighborhood must be large enough to capture texture structures and small enough to guarantee segmentation accuracy. These parameters are often set experimentally. These limitations are mitigated with the proposed variational methods stated at the region-level. It resorts to an energy criterion defined on image where regions are characterized by nonparametric distributions of their responses to a set of filters. In the supervised case, the segmentation algorithm consists in the minimization of a similarity measure between region-level statistics and texture prototypes and a boundary based functional that imposes smoothness and regularity on region boundaries. In the unsupervised case, the data-driven term involves the maximization of the dissimilarity between regions. The proposed similarity measure is generic and permits optimally fusing various types of texture features. It is defined as a weighted sum of Kullback-Leibler divergences between feature distributions. The optimization of the proposed variational criteria is carried out using a level-set formulation. The effectiveness and the robustness of this formulation at region-level, compared to classical active contour methods, are evaluated for various Brodatz and natural images.},

Theory IT-22, 25 (1976)] is extremely useful for characterizing spatiotemporal patterns in high-dimensionality nonlinear systems. It is shown that, for time series, c can be a finer measure for order than the Liapunov exponent. We find that, for simple cellular automata, pattern formation can be clearly separated from a mere reduction of the source entropy and different types of automata can be distinguished. For a chain of coupled logistic maps, c signals pattern formation which cannot be seen in the spatial correlation function alone.},

To blindly extract the independent source signals, we resort to the popular FastICA approach, whilst to adaptively estimate the parameters of such score functions, we use an efficient method based on maximum likelihood (ML). Experimental results with sources employing a wide range of statistical distributions, indicate that the proposed flexible FastICA (FF-ICA) technique significantly outperforms conventional independent component analysis (ICA) methods, which operate only on a fixed score function regime.},

A focus is put on an effect of different distributional properties on an ability of the methods to efficiently distinguish between short-term memory and long-term memory. To do so, we analyze the behavior of the estimators for independent, short-range dependent, and long-range dependent processes with innovations from eight different distributions. We find that apart from a combination of very high levels of kurtosis and skewness, both estimators are quite robust to distributional properties. Importantly, we show that R/S is biased upwards (yet not strongly) for short-range dependent processes, while M-R/S is strongly biased downwards for long-range dependent processes regardless of the distribution of innovations.},

We find that the Japanese NIKKEI is the most efficient market. From a geographical point of view, the more efficient markets are dominated by the European stock indices and the less efficient markets cover mainly Latin America, Asia and Oceania. The inefficiency is mainly driven by a local herding, i.e. a low fractal dimension.},

  abstract      = {The Singh--Maddala distribution is very flexible and most widely used for modeling the income, wage, expenditure and wealth distribution of the country. Several mathematical and statistical properties of this distribution (such as quantiles, moments, moment generating function, hazard rate, mean residual lifetime, mean deviation about mean and median, Bonferroni and Lorenz curves and various entropies) are derived. We establish relations for the single and product moments of generalized order statistics from the Singh--Maddala distribution and then we use these results to compute the first four moments and variance of order statistics and record values for sample different sizes for various values of the shape and scale parameters. For this distribution, two characterizing results based on conditional moments of generalized order statistics and recurrence relations for single moments are established. The method of maximum likelihood is adopted for estimating the unknown parameters.

  abstract  = {A new extension of moment exponential distribution, called exponentiated moment exponential distribution (EMED), was recently introduced by Hasnain [14]. Based on lower generalized order statistics, we first derive the explicit expressions as well as recurrence relations for single and product moments of lower generalized order statistics and we use these results to compute the means, variances and coefficients of skewness and kurtosis of EMED. Further, using a recurrence relation for single moment, we obtain characterization of EMED. Next we obtain the maximum likelihood estimators of the unknown parameters and the approximate confidence intervals of the EMED. Finally, we consider Bayes estimation under the symmetric and asymmetric loss functions using gamma priors for both shape and scale parameters. We have are also derived the Bayes interval of this distribution. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to compare the performances of the proposed methods.},

This new family of distributions is analytically quite tractable and it can be used quite effectively to analyze censored data also.

The ARFIMA–HYGARCH model is a long-memory model for the conditional mean that also allows for long memory in the conditional variance, the latter given by an HYGARCH model that nests both the GARCH and integrated GARCH models. It is therefore important to provide a thorough treatment of its statistical inference. Asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood estimators under the Student’s t distribution are established, and the asymptotic normality of the Gaussian quasi-maximum likelihood estimation is also derived. Two portmanteau test statistics based on the residual autocorrelations and squared residual autocorrelations are defined and their asymptotic distributions are derived. These tests will be useful in model diagnostic checking. Simulation results show that the tests have reasonable empirical size and power.},

  abstract      = { Four strategies for bias correction of the maximum likelihood estimator of the parameters in the Type I generalized logistic distribution are studied. First, we consider an analytic bias-corrected estimator, which is obtained by deriving an analytic expression for the bias to order n −1; second, a method based on modifying the likelihood equations; third, we consider the jackknife bias-corrected estimator; and fourth, we consider two bootstrap bias-corrected estimators. All bias correction estimators are compared by simulation. Finally, an example with a real data set is also presented. },

  abstract  = {A new lifetime distribution capable of modeling a bathtub-shaped hazard-rate function is proposed. The proposed model is derived as a limiting case of the Beta Integrated Model and has both the Weibull distribution and Type 1 extreme value distribution as special cases. The model can be considered as another useful 3-parameter generalization of the Weibull distribution. An advantage of the model is that the model parameters can be estimated easily based on a Weibull probability paper (WPP) plot that serves as a tool for model identification. Model characterization based on the WPP plot is studied. A numerical example is provided and comparison with another Weibull extension, the exponentiated Weibull, is also discussed. The proposed model compares well with other competing models to fit data that exhibits a bathtub-shaped hazard-rate function.},

We show that in our framework, imitation is critical to the generation of long memory persistence in many financial time series. This shows that imitation across trader behavior is probably crucial for understanding the dynamics of prices and trading volume.

  abstract  = {[fre] D\'ependance de court et de long terme des rendements de taux de change . par Christelle Lecourt . Dans cet article, nous estimons un modèle ARFTMA-GARCH introduit par Baillie, Bollerslev et Mikkelsen (1996) pour les quatre principaux rendements quotidiens de taux de change. Notre principale contribution est de tenir compte non seulement des effets ARCH à travers une mod\'elisation GARCH mais aussi de la kurtosis pr\'esente dans les s\'eries en choisissant la distribution de Student plutôt que la distribution normale. Les r\'esultats obtenus r\'evèlent que la plupart des s\'eries de rendements de taux de change ont une faible m\'emoire longue. Ces r\'esultats ont des implications \'economiques importantes. Tout d'abord, cela devrait permettre d'am\'eliorer les pr\'evisions de rendements. En second lieu, cela signifie que l'hypothèse d'efficience du march\'e au sens faible n'est pas v\'erifi\'ee. [eng] Short- and Long-Run Dependence of Exchange Rate Returns by Christelle Lecourt . in this paper, we estimate an ARFIMA-GARCH model as introduced by Baillie, Bollerslev and Mikkelsen (1996) for the four leading daily exchange rate returns. Our main contribution is to take account of ARCH effects using a GARCH model and to consider the kurtosis in the series by opting for a Student distribution rather than a normal distribution. The results obtained show that most of the exchange rate return series have a poor long-run memory. The economic implications of these findings are considerable. Firstly, they should help improve forecasts of returns. Secondly, they imply that the efficient market (in the weak sense) hypothesis does not hold.},

  abstract        = {There has been a renewed interest in developing more flexible statistical distributions in recent decades. A major milestone in the methods for generating statistical distributions is undoubtedly the system of differential equation approach. There is a recent renewed interest in generating skewed distributions. Generally speaking, the methods developed prior to 1980s may be summarized into three categories: (1) method of differential equation, (2) method of transformation, and (3) quantile method. Techniques developed since 1980s may be categorized as ‘methods of combination’ for the reason that these methods attempt to combine existing distributions into new distributions or adding new parameters to an existing distribution. This article discusses five general methods of combination and their variations. These five are (1) method of generating skew distributions, (2) method of adding parameters (e.g., exponentiation), (3) beta generated method, (4) transformed-transformer method, and (5) composite method.

  abstract  = {A new three-parameter exponential-type family of distributions which can be used in modeling survival data, reliability problems and fatigue life studies is introduced. Its failure rate function can be constant, decreasing, increasing, upside-down bathtub or bathtub-shaped depending on its parameters. It includes as special sub-models the exponential distribution, the generalized exponential distribution [Gupta, R.D., Kundu, D., 1999. Generalized exponential distributions. Australian and New Zealand Journalof Statistics 41, 173–188] and the extended exponential distribution [Nadarajah, S., Haghighi, F., 2011. An extension of the exponential distribution. Statistics 45, 543–558]. A comprehensive account of the mathematical properties of the new family of distributions is provided. Maximum likelihood estimation of the unknown parameters of the new model for complete sample as well as for censored sample is discussed. Estimation of the stress–strength parameter is also considered. Two empirical applications of the new model to real data are presented for illustrative purposes.},

We briefly discuss estimation of the model parameters of the new class of distributions based on two estimation methods. Additionally, a new regression model is introduced by considering the distribution proposed in this article, which is useful for situations where the response is restricted to the standard unit interval and the regression structure involves regressors and unknown parameters. The regression model allows to model both location and dispersion effects. We define two residuals for the proposed regression model to assess departures from model assumptions as well as to detect outlying observations, and discuss some influence methods such as the local influence and generalized leverage. Finally, an application to real data is presented to show the usefulness of the new regression model.},

  abstract  = {Abstract We address the issue of performing testing inference in Birnbaum–Saunders nonlinear regression models when the sample size is small. The likelihood ratio, Wald and score statistics provide the basis for testing inference on the parameters in this class of models. We focus on the small-sample case, where the reference chi-squared distribution gives a poor approximation to the true null distribution of these test statistics. We derive a general Bartlett-type correction in matrix notation for the score test, which reduces the size distortion of the test, and numerically compare the proposed test with the usual likelihood ratio, Wald and score tests, and with the Bartlett-corrected likelihood ratio test, and bootstrap-corrected tests. Our simulation results suggest that the proposed corrected test can be an interesting alternative to other tests since it leads to very accurate inference even for very small samples. We also present an empirical application for illustrative purposes. },

It is shown that these Gamma processes are time-reversible and, therefore, too narrow for general physical modelling. A dual process to the BGAR(l) process, DBGAR(l), is introduced, as well as an iterated process which combines the Beta-Gamma process and the GAR(l) process of Gaver and Lewis (1980).

  abstract  = {This paper presents a state-space based simulation model for multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) channels with spatio-temporal channel correlations due to clustered radio propagation. The scattering clusters are modeled as two-dimensional Cauchy (TDCA) clusters. This renders the joint probability density function (PDF) of angle of arrival (AOA) and angle of departure (AOD) that can be approximated as the product of two Cauchy angular power distributions. Thus, the spatio-temporal correlation can be approximated as the product of an autoregressive order one (AR1) model and the corresponding spatial antenna correlation. A state-space model is employed to the temporal dynamics of the MIMO channels. The contribution of the cluster to each antenna is a state in this model. A correlated innovation process adjusts the correlation between antennas. This renders the appropriate spatio-temporal channel correlation in the simulated channels.},

The autocorrelation function decays roughly as $\tau^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha \approx 0.6$, corresponding to a Hurst exponent $H \approx 0.7$. This implies that the signs of future orders are quite predictable from the signs of past orders; all else being equal, this would suggest a very strong market inefficiency. We demonstrate, however, that fluctuations in order signs are compensated for by anti-correlated fluctuations in transaction size and liquidity, which are also long-memory processes. This tends to make the returns whiter. We show that some institutions display long-range memory and others don't.},

  abstract      = {Abstract A fast and memory-saving PLS regression algorithm for matrices with large numbers of objects is presented. It is called the kernel algorithm for PLS. Long (meaning having many objects, N) matrices X (N × K) and Y (N × M) are condensed into a small (K × K) square ‘kernel’ matrix XTYYTX of size equal to the number of X-variables. Using this kernel matrix XTYYTX together with the small covariance matrices XTX (K × K), XTY (K × M) and YTY (M × M), it is possible to estimate all necessary parameters for a complete PLS regression solution with some statistical diagnostics. The new developments are presented in equation form. A comparison of consumed floating point operations is given for the kernel and the classical PLS algorithm. As appendices, a condensed matrix algebra version of the kernel algorithm is given together with the MATLAB code.},

We provide a rigorous analysis, based on results on sums of r.v.'s with a possibly finite first moment, of the aggregate variance and spectral density, as the number of micro units tends to infinity. If the AR coefficients lie below a critical away from unity, the aggregate process may exhibit infinite variance and long memory. Surprisingly, if the key parameter of the density function of the AR coefficients lies below a critical value (high density near unity), common and idiosyncratic components have the same importance in explaining aggregate variance, whereas the usual result, i.e. a vanishing importance of the idiosyncratic component, is obtained when the parameter lies above the critical value (low density near unity). Empirical analysis relative to major U.S. macroeconomic series, both in previous literature and in this paper, provides estimates of the parameter below the critical value.},

The DCCA-based cross-correlation coefficients are very high and decrease with the futures maturity increases. Using the multifractal extension of DCCA, the multifractality in cross-correlations is revealed. We also detect the source of cross-correlations between spot and futures markets. We use the vector error correction model and bivariate BEKK–GARCH to model the interactions between returns and volatilities of spot and futures, respectively. Our findings indicate that the volatility spillover between spot and futures markets contributes major to nonlinear cross-correlation while the contribution of mean spillover is very minor.},

  abstract  = {With the improvements in modern radar resolution, the Gaussian-fluctuation model based on the central limit theorem does not accurately describe the scattering echo from targets. in contrast, the heavytailed Rayleigh distribution, based on the generalized central limit theorem, performs well in modeling the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, whereas its application to multi-look image processing is difficult. We describe successful modeling of multilook polarimetric SAR images with the heavy-tailed Rayleigh distribution and present novel parameter estimators based on matrix log-cumulants for the heavy-tailed Rayleigh distribution including the equivalent number of looks (ENL). First, a compound variable of heavy-tailed Rayleigh distribution is divided into a product of a positive alpha-stable variable and a complex Gaussian variable. The parameter estimations of the characteristic exponent and scale parameter based on log-cumulants in a single polarization channel are then derived. Second, the matrix log-cumulants (MLCs) for full polarization in multilook images are obtained, which can be applied to estimate model parameters. Therefore, a novel ENL estimator based on MLC is presented that describes the model more precisely. Extended to all other multivariable product models, this estimator performs better than existing methods. Finally, calculations on both simulated and real data are performed that give good fits with theoretical results. Multilook processing in one image with a fixed pixel number can improve parameter estimations over single-look processing. Our heavy-tailed Rayleigh model with its parameter estimation provides a new method to analyze the multilook polarimetric SAR images for target detection and classification.},

In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large.

This test is applied to daily, weekly, monthly, and annual stock returns indexes over several different time periods. Contrary to previous findings, there is no evidence of long-range dependence in any of the indexes over any sample period or sub-period once short-term autocorrelations are taken into account.

An analysis of data on failures of four types of business in Poughkeepsie, New York, from 1844 to 1926 [2] confirms this expectation. The conditional probabilities of failure for these four series are well described by both exponential and hyperbolic functions.},

One class of models that was suggested to capture this behavior refers to the so-called Fractionally Integrated GARCH processes (Baillie, Bollerslev and Mikkelsen 1996) in which the ideas of fractional integration originally introduced by Granger (1980) and Hosking (1981) for processes for the mean are applied to a GARCH framework. in this paper we derive analytic expressions for the second-order derivatives of the log-likelihood function of FIGARCH processes with a view to the advantages that can be gained in computational speed and estimation accuracy. The comparison is computationally intensive given the typical sample size of the time series involved and the way the likelihood function is built. An illustration is provided on exchange rate and stock index data.},

  abstract  = {An important issue in functional MRI analysis is accurate characterisation of the noise processes present in the data. Whilst conventional fMRI noise representations often assume stationarity (or time-invariance) in the noise generating sources, such approaches may serve to suppress important dynamic information about brain function. As an alternative to these fixed temporal assumptions, we present in this paper two time-varying procedures for examining nonstationary noise structure in fMRI data. in the first procedure, we approximate nonstationary behaviour by means of a collection of simple but numerous time-varying parametric models. This is accomplished through the derivation of a locally parametric AutoRegressive (AR) plus drift model which tracks temporal covariance by allowing the model parameters to evolve over time. Before exploring time variation in these parameters, window-widths (bandwidths) that are well suited to the latent time-varying noise structure must be determined. To do this, we employ a bandwidth selection mechanism based on Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) criterion. in the second procedure, we describe the fMRI noise using a nonparametric method based on Functional Data Analysis (FDA). This process generates well-conditioned nonstationary covariance estimates that reflect temporal continuity in the underlying data structure whilst penalizing effective model dimension. We demonstrate both methods on simulated data and investigate the presence of nonstationary noise in resting fMRI data using the whitening capabilities of the locally parametric procedure. We evaluate the comparative behaviour of the stationary and nonstationary AR-based methods on data acquired at 1.5, 3 and 7 T magnetic field strengths and show that incorporation of time variation in the AR parameters leads to an overall decrease in the level of residual structure in the data. The FDA noise modelling technique is formulated within an activation mapping procedure and compared to the SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping) toolbox on a cognitive face recognition task. Both the SPM and FDA methods show good sensitivity on this task, but we find that inclusion of the nonstationary FDA noise model seems to improve detection power in important task-related medial temporal regions.},

The joint moment generating function as well as the main moments are provided. Inference is based on a usual maximum likelihood estimation approach.

We find that the sign and magnitude of the estimated impulse responses of hours to a positive technology shock depend crucially on the assumptions applied to identify them. Responses estimated with short-run identification are positive and statistically significant in all datasets analyzed. Long-run identification results in negative often not statistically significant responses. We check validity of these assumptions with the Sims (1989) procedure, concluding that both types of assumptions are appropriate to recover the impulse responses of hours in a fractionally integrated VAR. However, the application of longrun identification results in a substantial increase of the sampling uncertainty. JEL Classification numbers: C22, E32.

The degree of inflation persistence is then compared to estimates for the EU15 and for the euro area as well as for the individual member countries according to a unified approach. in order to assess the robustness of our estimates both a parametric and a non-parametric measure of inflation persistence is used. Overall, our results suggest a relatively low degree of inflation persistence in Luxembourg. For a large number of sub-indices we are not only able to reject the unit root hypothesis, but also we find a low degree of inflation persistence relative to other EU15 countries and relative to the EU15 and euro area aggregates. For Luxembourg as well as the other EU15 countries, our results suggest substantial heterogeneity in the degree of inflation persistence across sub-indices. We find some support for the presence of aggregation effects, both across indices and countries. Structural break tests for all EU15 countries suggest the presence of structural changes in the inflation process owing to the inception of the single monetary policy and/or to the modified treatment of sales.},

  abstract    = {High-frequency financial data are characterized by a set of ubiquitous statistical properties that prevail with surprising uniformity. While these 'stylized facts' have been well-known for decades, attempts at their behavioral explanation have remained scarce. However, recently a new branch of simple stochastic models of interacting traders have been proposed that share many of the salient features of empirical data. These models draw some of their inspiration from the broader current of behavioral finance. However, their design is closer in spirit to models of multi-particle interaction in physics than to traditional asset-pricing models. This reflects a basic insight in the natural sciences that similar regularities like those observed in financial markets (denoted as 'scaling laws' in physics) can often be explained via the microscopic interactions of the constituent parts of a complex system. Since these emergent properties should be independent of the microscopic details of the system, this viewpoint advocates negligence of the details of the determination of individuals' market behavior and instead focuses on the study of a few plausible rules of behavior and the emergence of macroscopic statistical regularities in a market with a large ensemble of traders. This chapter will review the philosophy of this new approach, its various implementations, and its contribution to an explanation of the stylized facts in finance<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

  abstract  = {This chapter describes a sequence of Monte Carlo methods: importance sampling, rejection sampling, the Metropolis method, and Gibbs sampling. For each method, we discuss whether the method is expected to be useful for high—dimensional problems such as arise in inference with graphical models. After the methods have been described, the terminology of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is presented. The chapter concludes with a discussion of advanced methods, including methods for reducing random walk behaviour. For details of Monte Carlo methods, theorems and proofs and a full list of references, the reader is directed to Neal (1993), Gilks, Richardson and Spiegelhalter (1996), and Tanner (1996).},

  abstract  = {The traditional methods of analyzing heart rate (HR) variability have failed to predict imminent ventricular fibrillation (VF). We sought to determine whether new methods of analyzing RR interval variability based on nonlinear dynamics and fractal analysis may help to detect subtle abnormalities in RR interval behavior before the onset of life-threatening arrhythmias. RR interval dynamics were analyzed from 24-hour Holter recordings of 15 patients who experienced VF during electrocardiographic recording. Thirty patients without spontaneous or inducible arrhythmia events served as a control group in this retrospective case control study. Conventional time- and frequency-domain measurements, the short-term fractal scaling exponent (alpha) obtained by detrended fluctuation analysis, and the slope (β) of the power-law regression line (log power − log frequency, 10−4 −10−2 Hz) of RR interval dynamics were determined. The short-term correlation exponent alpha of RR intervals (0.64 ± 0.19 vs 1.05 ± 0.12; p <0.001) and the power-law slope β (−1.63 ± 0.28 vs −1.31 ± 0.20, p <0.001) were lower in the patients before the onset of VF than in the control patients, but the SD and the low-frequency spectral components of RR intervals did not differ between the groups. The short-term scaling exponent performed better than any other measurement of HR variability in differentiating between the patients with VF and controls. Altered fractal correlation properties of HR behavior precede the spontaneous onset of VF. Dynamic analysis methods of analyzing RR intervals may help to identify abnormalities in HR behavior before VF.},

Wallis of IBM for stimulating discussions during our joint study of R/S by computer simulation; to Murad Taqqu of Columbia University for assistance in further simulations supported by the National Bureau of Economic Research, for permission to quote unpublished theorems from the thesis he wrote under my supervision [35], and for stimulating discussions; and to Hirsch Lewitan of IBM for programming assistance. Concerning the form of this paper, particular thanks are due to Ward Whitt of Yale University, who read the text as submitted in May 1974 and who has been extremely generous with time and advice. He tightened up Theorem 5 and Conjecture 5, suggested in passing the first variant in Section 13, disproved some wrong conjectures, and generally helped identify spots where further detail and/or more mathematical pedantry were required.},

We consider {cal G}_A^0 distribution parameters for SAR image segmentation, combined to the level set framework. The {cal G}_A^0 distribution belongs to a class of {cal G} distributions that have been successfully used to model different regions in amplitude SAR images for data modeling purpose. Such statistical data model is fundamental to deriving the energy functional to perform region mapping, which is input into our level set propagation numerical scheme that splits SAR images into homogeneous, heterogeneous, and extremely heterogeneous regions. Moreover, we introduce an assessment procedure based on stochastic distance and the {cal G}_A^0 model to quantify the robustness and accuracy of our approach. Our results demonstrate the accuracy of the algorithms regarding experiments on synthetic and real SAR data.},

  abstract    = {It has been recently emphasized that, if individuals have heterogeneous dynamics, estimates of shock persistence based on aggregate data are significatively higher than those derived from its disaggregate counterpart. However, a careful examination of the implications of this statement on the various tools routinely employed to measure persistence is missing in the literature. This paper formally examines this issue. We consider a disaggregate linear model with heterogeneous dynamics and compare the values of several measures of persistence across aggregation levels. Interestingly, we show that the average persistence of aggregate shocks, as measured by the impulse response function (IRF) of the aggregate model or by the average of the individual IRFs, is identical on all horizons. This result remains true even in situations where the units are (short-memory) stationary but the aggregate process is long-memory or even nonstationary. in contrast, other popular persistence measures, such as the sum of the autoregressive coefficients or the largest autoregressive root, tend to be higher the higher the aggregation level. We argue, however, that this should be seen more as an undesirable property of these measures than as evidence of different average persistence across aggregation levels. The results are illustrated in an application using U.S. inflation data.},

  abstract    = { The well-known lack of power of unit-root tests has often been attributed to the short length of macroeconomic variables and also to data-generating processes (DGPs) departing from the \&quot;I\&quot;(1)-\&quot;I\&quot;(0) models. This paper shows that by using long spans of annual real gross national product (GNP) and GNP per capita (133 years), high power can be achieved, leading to the rejection of both the unit-root and the trend-stationary hypothesis. More flexible representations are then considered, namely, processes containing structural breaks (SB) and fractional orders of integration (FI). Economic justification for the presence of these features in GNP is provided. It is shown that both FI and SB formulations are in general preferred to the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) [\&quot;I\&quot;(1) or \&quot;I\&quot;(0)] formulations. As a novelty in this literature, new techniques are applied to discriminate between FI and SB. It turns out that the FI specification is preferred, implying that GNP and GNP per capita are non-stationary, highly persistent but mean-reverting series. Finally, it is shown that the results are robust when breaks in the deterministic component are allowed for in the FI model. Some macroeconomic implications of these findings are also discussed.

The goal of this paper is to extend the classical testing framework for I(1) versus I(0)+ breaks by considering a more general class of models under the null hypothesis: non-stationary fractionally integrated (FI) processes. A similar identification problem holds in this broader setting which is shown to be a relevant issue from both a statistical and an economic perspective. The proposed test is developed in the time domain and is very simple to compute. The asymptotic properties of the new technique are derived and it is shown by simulation that it is very well-behaved in finite samples. To illustrate the usefulness of the proposed technique, an application using inflation data is also provided.},

The goal of this paper is to analyze this controversy using a general approach, with the aim of providing a plausible explanation for the existing contradictory results. We consider the inflation rates of 21 OECD countries which are modelled as fractionally integrated (FI) processes. First, we show analytically that FI can appear in inflation rates after aggregating individual prices from firms that face different costs of adjusting their prices. Then, we provide robust empirical evidence supporting the FI hypothesis using both classical and Bayesian techniques. Next, we estimate impulse response functions and other scalar measures of persistence, achieving an accurate picture of this property and its variation across countries. It is shown that the application of some popular tools for measuring persistence, such as the sum of the AR coefficients, could lead to erroneous conclusions if fractional integration is present. Finally, we explore the existence of changes in inflation inertia using a novel approach. We conclude that the persistence of inflation is very high (although non-permanent) in most post-industrial countries and that it has remained basically unchanged over the last four decades.},

By using long data spans and new econometric techniques, they showed that the unit root hypothesis could be rejected with high power. Using the same data set we first show that, if the hypotheses are reversed, also the trend stationary model can be easily rejected. This suggests that neither model provides a good characterization of this data. Long memory (ARFIMA) as well as non-linear models are considered as alternatives. Economic as well as statistical justification for the presence of these features in the data is provided. It turns out that the latter models and in general preferred to the former. Finally, a new technique is also applied to discriminate between these the long memory and the structural break models. It is shown that for both real GNP and real GNP per capita the preferred model turns out to be a fractionally integrated model with a memory parameter, d; around 0.7.

Those results are in agreement with theories of political allegiance based on aggregation of heterogeneous voters with different degrees of commitment and pragmatism. Further, those models are found to be useful in forecasting the results of the last general elections in Spain.

To reduce such bias of the MLEs from order to order , we adopt some bias-corrected techniques. in this paper, we adopt two approaches to derive first-order bias corrections for the the maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters of the Inverse Weibull distribution. The first one is the analytical methodology suggested by Cox and Snell (1968) and the second is based on the parametric Bootstrap resampling method. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to investigate the performance of these methodologies.

The model is able to simultaneously approximate long memory behavior, as well as describe sign and size asymmetries. A sequence of tests is developed to determine the number of regimes, and an estimation and testing procedure is presented. Monte Carlo simulations evaluate the finite-sample properties of the proposed tests and estimation procedures. We apply the model to several Dow Jones Industrial Average index stocks using transaction level data from the Trades and Quotes database that covers ten years of data. We find strong support for long memory and both sign and size asymmetries.

Generally, a test for a martingale is therefore a test for uncorrelated increments. A detrended process with an x- dependent drift coefficient is generally not a martingale, and so we extend our analysis to include the class of (x,t)-dependent drift coefficients of interest in finance. We explain why martingales look Markovian at the level of both simple averages and 2-point correlations. and while a Markovian market has no memory to exploit and presumably cannot be beaten systematically, it has never been shown that martingale memory cannot be exploited in 3-point or higher correlations to beat the market. We generalize our Markov scaling solutions presented earlier, and also generalize the martingale formulation of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) to include (x,t)- dependent drift in log returns. We also use the analysis of this paper to correct a misstatement of the ‘fair game’ condition in terms of serial correlations in Fama’s paper on the EMH. We end with a discussion of Levy’scharacterization of Brownian motion and prove that an arbitrary martingale is topologically inequivalent to a Wiener process.},

  abstract  = {Previous research related to the controversial Hurst phenomenon is reviewed and evaluated. Because of the inherent statistical properties of the rescaled adjusted range (RAR) statistic it is suggested that research primarily be devoted to this statistic rather than to the various definitions of the Hurst coefficient. Simulation studies reveal that for independently distributed random variables the RAR does not significantly depend on the underlying distribution of the random variables but is a function of the sample size. For modeling correlated data the statistical attributes of a discrete fractional Gaussian noise (FGN) process are studied and also improved. An efficient maximum likelihood estimation technique is developed for the FGN model, and it is shown how the residuals of the fitted model can be calculated and then subjected to diagnostic checks. An exact simulation procedure is developed for simulating FGN in such a way that synthetic traces from the model lie outside the Brownian domain. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) is suggested as a method for choosing between a FGN and a Box-Jenkins model. For the six annual river flow series that are considered the AIC selects the best Box-Jenkins model in preference to the FGN process for each data set. Because Box-Jenkins models can be shown to preserve the historical RAR, in many practical applications it may be advantageous to use a Box-Jenkins model instead of a FGN process.},

Estimation of a FIGARCH model supports the contention that volatility dynamics result from multiple sources.

  abstract      = {This paper proposes an information theoretic criterion for comparing two partitions, or clusterings, of the same data set. The criterion, called variation of information (VI), measures the amount of information lost and gained in changing from clustering C to clustering C′. The basic properties of VI are presented and discussed. We focus on two kinds of properties: (1) those that help one build intuition about the new criterion (in particular, it is shown the VI is a true metric on the space of clusterings), and (2) those that pertain to the comparability of VI values over different experimental conditions. As the latter properties have rarely been discussed explicitly before, other existing comparison criteria are also examined in their light. Finally we present the VI from an axiomatic point of view, showing that it is the only “sensible” criterion for comparing partitions that is both aligned to the lattice and convexely additive. As a consequence, we prove an impossibility result for comparing partitions: there is no criterion for comparing partitions that simultaneously satisfies the above two desirable properties and is bounded.},

We propose a new extended regression model based on the logarithm of the exponentiated log-logistic geometric distribution. This regression model can be very useful in the analysis of real data and could provide better fits than other special regression models. The potentiality of the new models is illustrated by means of two applications to real lifetime data sets.},

  abstract  = {This paper analyzes the dual long memory properties of four major foreign exchange markets of the world oil exporter Saudi Arabia, using the ARFIMA–FIGARCH model under several global events. It discerns the impacts of both scheduled and unscheduled news announcements and structural changes on changing persistence. The results show little evidence of long memory in the conditional mean but provide strong support for long memory in conditional volatility for the four Saudi exchange rates versus major currencies. Moreover, scheduled news announcements have no significant impact on both expectations and volatility, while unscheduled news announcements demonstrate significant effects on the conditional volatility for all exchange rates. Furthermore, we detect at least five structural changes for the exchange rate with the yen and four for the rest of the exchange rates. The structural breaks seem to have greater impacts on changing persistence, and that the ARFIMA–FIGARCH model coupled with the dummy variables of the unscheduled news announcements and the structural changes is the most suitable for examining the long memory processes of these foreign exchange markets in in-sample. Finally, the out-of-sample forecasts provide mixed results and indicate that none of the specifications of the volatility model is appropriate for analyzing the LM dynamics in the Saudi Arabian exchange market. Overall, our results have implications for portfolio managers and policy makers in oil-producing countries.},

  abstract    = {It is well known from time series analysis that shocks to aggregate output have very persistent effects. This paper argues that the relation between the expected growth rate of a firm and its size\ provides a microfoundation for such aggregate persistence. The empirical evidence indicates that small firms grow faster than big ones. If this is true, a shock that reallocates units across sizes will be absorbed, yet at very low decreasing rates. Once the shock hits the system, firms are reallocated across sizes. If small firms grows faster than big ones, the shock will then be absorbed. However, fast growing small firms eventually become big and grow as big firms. Thus the number of small firms shrinks over time as well as the rate at which the shock is absorbed. This transmission mechanism reconciles the micro evidence with the observed degree of aggregate persistence. It requires changes in neither the number of firms in the market nor the rate of technological progress. It is merely the result of the cross-sectional heterogeneity that we observe in real economies.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

Time series generated by nonlinear transformations of random walks with thick-tailed innovations have asymptotic autocorrelations that decay very slowly as the number of lags increases or do not even decay at all and remain constant at all lags. Depending upon the type of transformation considered and how the model error is specified, they are given by random constants, deterministic functions which decay slowly at polynomial rates, or mixtures of the two. These autocorrelation patterns, along with other sample characteristics of the transformed time series, suggest the possibility that these three ingredients are involved in the data generating processes for many actual economic and financial time series data. We also discuss nonlinear regression asymptotics when the regressor is observable and an alternative regression technique when it is unobservable. We use our model to analyze two empirical applications: exchange rates governed by a target zone and electricity price spikes driven by capacity shortfalls.},

Given similar evidence for other OECD countries, many macroeconomists have concluded that high inflation persistence is a 'stylized fact'. The objective of this paper is to show that degree of inflation persistence is not an inherent structural characteristic of an economy, but in fact a function of the stability and transparency of monetary policy regime in place. We begin by estimating univariate processes for inflation across different periods, allowing for structural breaks based on a priori knowledge of the UK economy. Then we examine whether, a rather straightforward model, easily micro-founded in a standard classical set-up can generate the facts such as we find them. We calibrate our structural model for each of the regimes and solve it analytically for the implied persistence in the inflation process. We compare this theoretical prediction with the estimated persistence for each regime. Finally we bootstrap our model to generate pseudo inflation series and check whether the actual persistence coefficients lie within the 95 percent confidence limits implied by the bootstraps. As a robustness exercise we do the same for the Liverpool model.},

The implication of our finding is that the persistence process governing TFP series is non-linear, stationary for some period and (mildly) explosive for others pointing to the fact that linear policy rules to counteract stochastic shocks in TFP may not prove useful. The repeat of TFP cycles is traced to this behaviour.},

  abstract  = {In statistical practice, incomplete measurement sequences are the rule rather than the exception. 
Fortunately, in a large variety of settings, the stochastic mechanism governing the incompleteness can be ignored without 
hampering inferences about the measurement process. While ignorability only requires the relatively general 
missing at random assumption for likelihood and Bayesian inferences, this result cannot be invoked when non-likelihood methods are used. 
A direct consequence of this is that a popular non-likelihood-based method, such as generalized estimating equations, 
needs to be adapted towards a weighted version or doubly-robust version when a missing at random process operates. 
So far, no such modification has been devised for pseudo-likelihood based strategies. 
We propose a suite of corrections to the standard form of pseudo-likelihood to ensure its validity under missingness at random. 
Our corrections follow both single and double robustness ideas, and is relatively simple to apply. 
When missingness is in the form of dropout in longitudinal data or incomplete clusters, 
such a structure can be exploited toward further corrections. The proposed method is applied to data 
from a clinical trial in onychomycosis and a developmental toxicity study.},

For this dispersion an alternative measure, based on quantiles, is proposed here. It is shown to have several desirable properties: (i) the measure exists even for distributions for which no moments exist, (ii) it is not influenced by the (extreme) tails of the distribution, and (iii) the calculation is simple (and is even possible by graphical means).},

The Markov switching ARFIMA model generalises the standard ARFIMA model allowing mean reversion to take place with respect to a changing unconditional mean. By imposing a coswitching restriction for nominal money growth and HICP inflation we are able to identify three regimes and establish a linkage between the long-run dynamics of inflation and money growth. The last regime has been found to be coherent with the objective of price stability and can be tentatively named EMU regime. The core inflation model has been contrasted with other models suggested in the literature and found to be superior in terms of forecasting power. JEL Classification: C22, E31, E52},

Moreover, it is closed under proportional hazards meodeling, which is desirable, interesting and convenient in studies involving multiple samples occurring in repair-reuse type reliability situations. The analysis of multisample data is illustrated using the bus motor failure mileages first studied by Davis(l952). },

The space of shape parameters alpha > 0 and θ > 0 can be divided by boundary line alpha = 1 and curve alphaθ = 1 into four regions over which the hazard function is, respectively, increasing, bathtub-shaped, decreasing, and unimodal. The new family is suitable for modeling data that indicate nonmonotone hazard rates and can be adopted for testing goodness of fit of Weibull as a submodel. The usefulness and flexibility of the family is illustrated by reanalyzing five classical data sets on bus-motor failures from Davis that are typical of data in repair-reuse situations and Efron's data pertaining to a head-and-neck-cancer clinical trial. These illustrative data involve censoring and indicate bathtub, unimodal, and increasing but possibly non-Weibull hazard-shape models.},

  abstract      = {Image segmentation is a very important and pre-processing step in image analysis. The conventional multilevel thresholding methods are efficient for bi-level thresholding because of its simplicity, robustness, less convergence time and accuracy. However, a mass of computational cost is needed and efficiency is broken down as an exhaustive search is utilized for finding the optimal thresholds, which results in application of evolutionary algorithm and swarm intelligence to obtain the optimal thresholds. The main aim of image segmentation was to segregate the foreground from background. For the first time this paper established a naturally inspired firefly algorithm based multilevel image thresholding for image segmentation by maximizing Shannon entropy or Fuzzy entropy. The proposed algorithm is tested on standard set of images and results are compared with the Shannon entropy or Fuzzy entropy based methods that are optimized by Differential Evolution (DE), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and bat algorithm (BA). It is demonstrated that the proposed method shows better performance in objective function, structural similarity index, peak signal to noise ratio, misclassification error and CPU time than state of art methods.},

We discuss the frequency and polarization characteristics of the backscattering coefficients of sea ice and then characterize its thickness by comparing the corresponding backscattering coefficient for each polarization with the physical parameters of the ice. We first propose a methodology for classifying sea-ice types by using a polarimetric decomposition technique, before comparing an estimation of the sea-ice thickness with the corresponding dual-frequency, multipolarization SAR data. We utilized the backscattering ratio to estimate the thickness of the sea ice. This ratio canceled the effect of roughness on the backscattering. The method was validated using Pi-SAR (polarimetric and interferometric airborne SAR) observation data obtained at ground-truth sites.},

  abstract  = {Images obtained with coherent illumination, as is the case of sonar, ultrasound-B, laser, and synthetic aperture radar, are affected by speckle noise which reduces the ability to extract information from the data. Specialized techniques are required to deal with such imagery, which has been modeled by the G 0 distribution and, under which, regions with different degrees of roughness and mean brightness can be characterized by two parameters; a third parameter, which is the number of looks, is related to the overall signal-to-noise ratio. Assessing distances between samples is an important step in image analysis; they provide grounds of the separability and, therefore, of the performance of classification procedures. This paper derives and compares eight stochastic distances and assesses the performance of hypothesis tests that employ them and maximum likelihood estimation. We conclude that tests based on the triangular distance have the closest empirical size to the theoretical one, while those based on the arithmetic-geometric distances have the best power. Since the power of tests based on the triangular distance is close to optimum, we conclude that the safest choice is using this distance for hypothesis testing, even when compared with classical distances as Kullback-Leibler and Bhattacharyya.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes improved methods for the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the equivalent number of looks L. This parameter has a meaningful interpretation in the context of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images. Due to the presence of coherent illumination in their processing, PolSAR systems generate images which present a granular noise called speckle. As a potential solution for reducing such interference, the parameter L controls the signal-noise ratio. Thus, the proposal of efficient estimation methodologies for L has been sought. To that end, we consider first that a PolSAR image is well described by the scaled complex Wishart distribution. in recent years, Anfinsen have derived and analyzed estimation methods based on the ML and on trace statistical moments for obtaining the parameter L of the unscaled version of such probability law. This paper generalizes that approach. We present the second-order bias expression proposed by Cox and Snell for the ML estimator of this parameter. Moreover, the formula of the profile likelihood modified by Barndorff-Nielsen in terms of L is discussed. Such derivations yield two new ML estimators for the parameter L, which are compared to the estimators proposed by Anfinsen The performance of these estimators is assessed by means of Monte Carlo experiments, adopting three statistical measures as comparison criterion: the mean square error, the bias, and the coefficient of variation. Equivalently to the simulation study, an application to actual PolSAR data concludes that the proposed estimators outperform all the others in homogeneous scenarios.},

  abstract  = {Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) has achieved a prominent position as a remote imaging method. However, PolSAR images are contaminated by speckle noise due to the coherent illumination employed during the data acquisition. This noise provides a granular aspect to the image, making its processing and analysis (such as in edge detection) hard tasks. This paper discusses seven methods for edge detection in multilook PolSAR images. in all methods, the basic idea consists in detecting transition points in the finest possible strip of data which spans two regions. The edge is contoured using the transitions points and a B-spline curve. Four stochastic distances, two differences of entropies, and the maximum likelihood criterion were used under the scaled complex Wishart distribution; the first six stem from the h-φ class of measures. The performance of the discussed detection methods was quantified and analyzed by the computational time and probability of correct edge detection, with respect to the number of looks, the backscatter matrix as a whole, the SPAN, the covariance an the spatial resolution. The detection procedures were applied to three real PolSAR images. Results provide evidence that the methods based on the Bhattacharyya distance and the difference of Shannon entropies outperform the other techniques.},

This family of distributions, which is a generalization of location-scale mixture of normal and beta distributions, contain some existing and important distributions and is appropriate for modeling data with skewness and heavy tail structure. Some distributional properties and the moments of this new family of distributions are obtained. in the special case of location-scale mixture of skew-normal distribution, we estimate the parameters via an EM-type algorithm and a simulation study and an application to real data are provided for illustration. Finally we extend some results to multivariate case. },

Using a very disaggregated database, it investigates the joint evolution of sectoral US manufacturing total factor productivity (TFP) using a semi-parametric spatial vector autoregressive framework. in this approach the interrelationship between sectors is a function on the \&quot;economic distance\&quot; between them. This distance is computed either from factor input shares or from input-output tables. It is found that sectoral TFP growth rates move independently from each other and that there is little evidence of complementarities or spillovers across sectors.

  abstract      = {X-ray image segmentation is an important and crucial step for three-dimensional (3D) bone reconstruction whose final goal remains to increase effectiveness of computer-aided diagnosis, surgery and treatment plannings. However, this segmentation task is rather challenging, particularly when dealing with complicated human structures in the lower limb such as the patella, talus and pelvis. In this work, we present a multi-atlas fusion framework for the automatic segmentation of these complex bone regions from a single X-ray view. The first originality of the proposed approach lies in the use of a (training) dataset of co-registered/pre-segmented X-ray images of these aforementioned bone regions (or multi-atlas) to estimate a collection of superpixels allowing us to take into account all the nonlinear and local variability of bone regions existing in the training dataset and also to simplify the superpixel map pruning process related to our strategy. The second originality is to introduce a novel label propagation step based on the entropy concept for refining the resulting segmentation map into the most likely internal regions to the final consensus segmentation. In this framework, a leave-one-out cross-validation process was performed on 31 manually segmented radiographic image dataset for each bone structure in order to rigorously evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. The proposed method resulted in more accurate segmentations compared to the probabilistic patch-based label fusion model (PB) and the classical patch-based majority voting fusion scheme (MV) using different registration strategies. Comparison with manual (gold standard) segmentations revealed that the good classification accuracy of our unsupervised segmentation scheme is, respectively, 93.79% for the patella, 88.3% for the talus and 85.02% for the pelvis; a score that falls within the range of accuracy levels of manual segmentations (due to the intra inter/observer variability).},

We investigate the dynamics of order cancelation by studying the statistical properties of inter-cancelation durations, defined as the waiting times between consecutive order cancelations of 22 liquid stocks traded on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange of China in year 2003. Three types of cancelations are considered, including cancelation of any limit orders, of buy limit orders and of sell limit orders. We find that the distributions of the inter-cancelation durations of individual stocks can be well modeled by Weibulls for each type of cancelation, and the distributions of rescaled durations of each type of cancelations exhibit a scaling behavior for different stocks. Complex intra-day patterns are also unveiled in the inter-cancelation durations. The detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and the multifractal DFA show that the inter-cancelation durations possess long-term memory and multifractal nature, which are not influenced by the intra-day patterns. No clear crossover phenomenon is observed in the detrended fluctuation functions with respect to the time scale. These findings indicate that the cancelation of limit orders is a non-Poisson process, which has potential worth in the construction of order-driven market models.},

The performance of the proposed bootstrap percentile charts is considered based on computer simulations, and some comparisons are made with an existing Weibull percentile chart. The new bootstrap chart indicates a shift in the process percentile substantially quicker than the previously existing chart, while maintaining comparable average run lengths when the process is in control.

  abstract    = {Statistical methods classically used to analyse a probability density function (pdf) are founded on the Fourier transform, on which useful tools such the first and second characteristic function are based, yielding the definitions of moments and cumulants. Yet this transformation is badly adapted to the analysis of probability density functions defined on R+, for which the analytic expressions of the characteristic functions may become hard, or even impossible to formulate. in this article we propose to substitute the Fourier transform with the Mellin transform. It is then possible, inspired by the precedent definitions, to introduce second kind statistics: second kind characteristic functions, second kind moments (or log-moments), and second kind cumulants (or log-cumulants). Applied to traditional distributions like the gamma distribution or the Nakagami distribution, this approach gives results that are easier to apply than the classical approach. Moreover, for more complicated distributions, like the K distributions or the positive alpha- stable distributions, the second kind statistics give expressions that are truly simple and easy to exploit. The new approach leads to innovative methods for estimating the parameters of distributions defined on R+. It is possible to compare the estimators obtained with estimators based on maximum likelihood theory and the method of moments. One can thus show that the new methods have variances that are considerably lower than those mentioned, and slightly higher than the Cramer-Rao bound.},

For performance evaluation of the proposed methodology, we employ the error of segmentation, the cross-region fitting index, the Dice measure, as well as the rates of false positives and negatives. Tests have been performed on synthetic and real SAR images and the matrix of entropy has improved the results, regardless of the increase of the number of looks.

We provide six special models of the new family. Some of its mathematical properties including explicit expressions for the ordinary and incomplete moments, generating function, R\'enyi and Shannon entropies, order statistics and probability weighted moments are derived. The estimation of the model parameters is performed by maximum likelihood. The flexibility of the proposed family is illustrated by means of three applications to real data sets.},

Initially texture segmentation necessitates the computation of various spatial dependencies, interactions and associations between the primitives of an image texture. However, regions in texture and their primitives are not always crisply defined, indeed, they can be regarded as fuzzy subsets of an image texture. Such variable nature in the underlying texture distribution makes precise object classification a difficult task, and has thus acted as stimulus to this work. The paper describes the unsupervised classification of texture based on a fuzzy clustering technique. Comparison is made to an equivalent crisp clustering algorithm in an attempt to put an order on the peculiarities and advantages of the technique, emphasising those aspects most important to the nature of the classification problem posed. It is seen that both techniques offer a high degree of classification accuracy, but more importantly our comparative studies offer the appropriateness of the techniques to specific applications.<<ETX>>},

This new family has the advantage of being capable of modeling various shapes of aging and failure criteria. The proposed family includes as special cases several Marshall–Olkin extended distributions studied in the literature such as exponential, Rayleigh, linear failure rate and Weibull, among others. Some statistical and reliability properties of the new family are discussed and an explicit expressions for the quantiles are derived. The method of the maximum likelihood estimation is used to estimate the unknown parameters. in addition, the asymptotic confidence intervals for the parameters are derived from the Fisher information matrix. Finally, the obtained results are validated using some real data sets and it is shown that the new family provides a better fit than some other known distributions. },

The theoretical background behind the model is discussed and various different correlated gamma-distributed surface models are analysed. The K-distributed clutter properties consequent on coherent imaging of such surfaces are next derived and their dependence on the imaging response function demonstrated. The theoretical results for a double coherence length surface model are then compared with overland images obtained with the RSRE X -band synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) processor. It is demonstrated that the model provides a reasonable representation of the dependence of the real image on the system resolution. The significance of such correlated K-distribution models on the understanding and prediction of clutter statistics is discussed and the direction for future research indicated.},

When the same procedure is applied to a more complicated scene, including regenerating areas, the equivalent results are 93.8% and 67.3%, When predictable corrections for shadowing and the presence of a highway are introduced, the not-forest joint probability is improved to about 78%.

  abstract  = {We report an empirical analysis of long-range dependence in the returns of eight stock market indices, using the Rescaled Range Analysis (RRA) to estimate the Hurst exponent. Monte Carlo and bootstrap simulations are used to construct critical values for the null hypothesis of no long-range dependence. The issue of disentangling short-range and long-range dependence is examined. Pre-filtering by fitting a (short-range) autoregressive model eliminates part of the long-range dependence when the latter is present, while failure to pre-filter leaves open the possibility of conflating short-range and long-range dependence. There is a strong evidence of long-range dependence for the small central European Czech stock market index PX-glob, and a weaker evidence for two smaller western European stock market indices, MSE (Spain) and SWX (Switzerland). There is little or no evidence of long-range dependence for the other five indices, including those with the largest capitalizations among those considered, DJIA (US) and FTSE350 (UK). These results are generally consistent with prior expectations concerning the relative efficiency of the stock markets examined.},

Critical values for the test statistics are generated using Monte Carlo simulations of random Gaussian innovations. Evidence is reported of multifractality, and the departure from random walk behaviour is statistically significant on standard criteria. The observed pattern is attributed primarily to fat tails in the return probability distribution, associated with volatility clustering in returns measured over various time scales.},

The cure model considers that a fraction of the survivors are cured of the disease. The survival function for the population of patients can be modeled by a cure parametric model using the BW distribution. We derive an explicit expansion for the moments of the recurrence time distribution for the uncured individuals. The proposed distribution can be used to model survival data when the hazard rate function is increasing, decreasing, unimodal and bathtub shaped. Another advantage is that the proposed model includes as special sub-models some of the well-known cure rate models discussed in the literature. We derive the appropriate matrices for assessing local influence on the parameter estimates under different perturbation schemes. We analyze a real data set for localized prostate cancer patients after open radical prostatectomy. },

Some of these techniques use only the gray level histogram, some use spatial details while others use fuzzy set theoretic approaches. Most of these techniques are not suitable for noisy environments. Some works have been done using the Markov Random Field (MRF) model which is robust to noise, but is computationally involved. Neural network architectures which help to get the output in real time because of their parallel processing ability, have also been used for segmentation and they work fine even when the noise level is very high. The literature on color image segmentation is not that rich as it is for gray tone images. This paper critically reviews and summarizes some of these techniques. Attempts have been made to cover both fuzzy and non-fuzzy techniques including color image segmentation and neural network based approaches. Adequate attention is paid to segmentation of range images and magnetic resonance images. It also addresses the issue of quantitative evaluation of segmentation results.},

  abstract  = { It is argued that the study of the correct specification of returns distributions has attractive implications in financial economics. This study estimates Levy-stable (fractal) distributions that can accurately account for skewness, kurtosis, and fat tails. The Levy-stable family distributions are parametrized by the Levy index (alpha), 0 &lt; (alpha), ≤ 2, and include the normal distribution as a special case (alpha = 2). The Levy index, alpha, is the fractal dimension of the probability space. The unique feature of Levy-stable family distributions is the existence of a relationship between the fractal dimension of the probability space andthe fractal dimensionof the time series. This relationshipis simply expressed in terms of Hurst exponent (H), i.e. alpha = 1/ H. in addition, Hurst exponent is related to long-memory effects. Thus, estimating the Levy index allows us to determine long-memory effects. The immediate practical implication of the present work is that on the one hand we estimate the shape of returns distributions and on the other hand we investigate the fractal dimensions. Overall, then, the Levy-stable family distributions methodology appears to be useful for analysing the returns distribution, for understanding the fractal dimension of returns and for providing the researcher with direct insights into the long-memory effects of stock returns. A second approach to test the long memory hypothesis is attempted in this paper. This test involves an estimation of the ARFIMA models. A comparative analysis of the two approaches indicates the existence of long-memory in the Athens Stock Exchange. The results of this study are based on a sample of stocks from the Athens Stock Exchange using daily data.},

  abstract      = {Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has over the years evolved to be one of the most promising remote sensing modalities for large-scale monitoring of the ocean and maritime activity. The use of SAR imagery in a variety of monitoring applications has motivated significant research on the statistical modelling of such images, with recent work focusing on the ability of the data’s heavy-tailed nature to be accurately modelled using distributions such as the a-stable and the Generalised Rayleigh distribution. Certain SAR applications, such as the detection of ships at sea have however as of yet not benefited from the use of these newly proposed statistical models. In this paper we present a Cauchy-Rayleigh Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) detector for the detection of ships at sea, showing that it can achieve superior performance to other previously used variants such as Weibull CFAR. We demonstrate the performance of our detector on high resolution TerraSAR-X data.},

  abstract    = { in this paper, we consider nonlinear transformations of random walks driven by thick-tailed innovations with undefined means or variances. in particular, we show how nonlinearity, nonstationarity, and thick tails interact to generate persistency in memory, and we clearly demonstrate that this triad may generate a broad spectrum of persistency patterns. Time series generated by nonlinear transformations of random walks with thick-tailed innovations have asymptotic autocorrelations that decay very slowly as the number of lags increases or do not even decay at all and remain constant at all lags. Depending upon the type of transformation considered and how the model error is specified, they are given by random constants, deterministic functions which decay slowly at polynomial rates, or mixtures of the two. These patterns in autocorrelations, along with other sample characteristics of the transformed time series, make it very plausible that this triad is involved in the data generating processes for many actual economic and financial time series data. We use our model to analyze two empirical applications: exchange rates governed by a target zone and electricity price spikes driven by capacity shortfalls},

We propose to measure the importance of a given variable within existing composite indicators via Karl Pearson's ‘correlation ratio’; we call this measure the ‘main effect’. Because socio-economic variables are heteroscedastic and correlated, relative nominal weights are hardly ever found to match relative main effects; we propose to summarize their discrepancy with a divergence measure. We discuss to what extent the mapping from nominal weights to main effects can be inverted. This analysis is applied to six composite indicators, including the human development index and two popular league tables of university performance. It is found that in many cases the declared importance of single indicators and their main effect are very different, and that the data correlation structure often prevents developers from obtaining the stated importance, even when modifying the nominal weights in the set of non-negative numbers with unit sum.},

This modification allows for time-varying first and second moments via means of Flexible Fourier transforms. A nice feature of this model is its ability to capture both short and long run dynamics in the volatility of the data, requiring only that the proper frequencies of the Fourier transform be specified. Several simulations show the ability of the Fourier series to approximate breaks of an unknown form, irrespective of the time or location of breaks. The paper shows that the main cause of the long run memory effect seen in stock returns is the result of a time varying first moment. in addition, the study suggests that allowing only the second moment to vary over time is not sufficient to capture the high persistence observed in lagged returns.},

  abstract  = {The five parameter Kumaraswamy generalized gamma model (Pascoa et al., 2011) includes some important distributions as special cases and it is very useful for modeling lifetime data. We propose an extended version of this distribution by assuming that a shape parameter can take negative values. The new distribution can accommodate increasing, decreasing, bathtub and unimodal shaped hazard functions. A second advantage is that it also includes as special models reciprocal distributions such as the reciprocal gamma and reciprocal Weibull distributions. A third advantage is that it can represent the error distribution for the log-Kumaraswamy generalized gamma regression model. We provide a mathematical treatment of the new distribution including explicit expressions for moments, generating function, mean deviations and order statistics. We obtain the moments of the log-transformed distribution. The new regression model can be used more effectively in the analysis of survival data since it includes as submodels several widely-known regression models. The method of maximum likelihood and a Bayesian procedure are used for estimating the model parameters for censored data. Overall, the new regression model is very useful to the analysis of real data.},

  abstract      = {The Wald statistic is one of the most commonly used tools in applied statistics, so it is sobering to read Fears, Benichou, and Gail's recent reminder of its fallibility. What makes their example particularly relevant is the fact that the problem is manifest in a simple normal random effects model on a balanced dataset for a seemingly harmless parameter, while, in practice, one tends to rely on the Wald test in complicated or nonnormal models where there are no exact tests to serve as a gold standard. This article explains the failure of the Wald test via the profile likelihood functions, which graphically look decidedly nonnormal. The methodology used to derive the profile likelihood and the discussion of this example could be instructive for a senior or beginning graduate class in theory of statistics.},

We address the question of whether such correlations may be a trivial consequence of the known mosaic structure ("patchiness") of DNA. We analyze two classes of controls consisting of patchy nucleotide sequences generated by different algorithms--one without and one with long-range power-law correlations. Although both types of sequences are highly heterogenous, they are quantitatively distinguishable by an alternative fluctuation analysis method that differentiates local patchiness from long-range correlations. Application of this analysis to selected DNA sequences demonstrates that patchiness is not sufficient to account for long-range correlation properties.},

By varying the threshold according to the sample size [Smith, R.L., 1987. Estimating tails of probability distributions. Ann. Statist. 15, 1174–1207] and [Drees, H., Ferreira, A., de Haan, L., 2004. On maximum likelihood estimation of the extreme value index. Ann. Appl. Probab. 14, 1179–1201] derived the asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) when the extreme value index is larger than -12. Recently Zhou [2009. Existence and consistency of the maximum likelihood estimator for the extreme value index. J. Multivariate Anal. 100, 794–815] showed that the MLE is consistent when the extreme value index is larger than -1. in this paper, we study the asymptotic distributions of MLE when the extreme value index is in between -1 and -12 (including -12). Particularly, we consider the MLE for the endpoint of the generalized Pareto distribution and the extreme value index and show that the asymptotic limit for the endpoint estimate is non-normal, which connects with the results in Woodroofe [1974. Maximum likelihood estimation of translation parameter of truncated distribution II. Ann. Statist. 2, 474–488]. Moreover, we show that same results hold for estimating the endpoint of the underlying distribution, which generalize the results in Hall [1982. On estimating the endpoint of a distribution. Ann. Statist. 10, 556–568] to irregular case, and results in Woodroofe [1974. Maximum likelihood estimation of translation parameter of truncated distribution II. Ann.

The limitation of the heavy-tailed Rayleigh model in SAR image application is discussed. We also present an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm based parameter estimation method for the Cauchy-Rayleigh mixture. We test the new model on some simulated data in order to confirm that is appropriate to the heavy-tailed Rayleigh model. The performance is evaluated by some statistic values (cumulative square errors (CSE) &lt; 0.013, correlation coefficient (CC) &gt; 0.99 and Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance (K-S) &lt; 0.03). Finally, the performance of the proposed mixture model is tested on some real SAR images and compared with other models, including the heavy-tailed Rayleigh and Nakagami mixture models. The result indicates that the proposed model can be an optional statistical model for amplitude SAR images.},

  abstract  = {Cure rate estimation is an important issue in clinical trials for diseases such as lymphoma and breast cancer and mixture models are the main statistical methods. in the last decade, mixture models under different distributions, such as exponential, Weibull, log-normal and Gompertz, have been discussed and used. However, these models involve stronger distributional assumptions than is desirable and inferences may not be robust to departures from these assumptions. in this paper, a mixture model is proposed using the generalized F distribution family. Although this family is seldom used because of computational difficulties, it has the advantage of being very flexible and including many commonly used distributions as special cases. The generalised F mixture model can relax the usual stronger distributional assumptions and allow the analyst to uncover structure in the data that might otherwise have been missed. This is illustrated by fitting the model to data from large-scale clinical trials with long follow-up of lymphoma patients. Computational problems with the model and model selection methods are discussed. Comparison of maximum likelihood estimates with those obtained from mixture models under other distributions are included.},

This paper will show that it is possible to eliminate this problem of significance tests. We present here the beginning of a larger research project.

  abstract    = {This paper considers the problem of aggregation in the case of large linear dynamic panels, where each micro unit is potentially related to all other micro units, and where micro innovations are allowed to be cross sectionally dependent. Following Pesaran (2003), an optimal aggregate function is derived, and the limiting behavior of the aggregation error is investigated as N (the number of cross section units) increases. Certain distributional features of micro parameters are also identified from the aggregate function. The paper then establishes Granger's (1980) conjecture regarding the long memory properties of aggregate variables from 'a very large scale dynamic, econometric model', and considers the time profiles of the effects of macro and micro shocks on the aggregate and disaggregate variables. Some of these findings are illustrated in Monte Carlo experiments, where we also study the estimation of the aggregate effects of micro and macro shocks. The paper concludes with an empirical application to consumer price inflation in Germany, France and Italy, and re-examines the extent to which 'observed' inflation persistence at the aggregate level is due to aggregation and/or common unobserved factors. Our findings suggest that dynamic heterogeneity as well as persistent common factors are needed for explaining the observed persistence of the aggregate inflation.},

The paper shows how the results in the literature can be readily obtained using the proposed forecasting approach, and provides a number of important extensions and generalisations. in particular, it does not require the assumption of independence of the micro distributed lag coefficients, and establishes that in general the long-run coefficients obtained from the optimal aggregate relation are equal to the averages of the long-run coefficients from the micro relations. Finally, the approach advocated in the paper is applied to aggregation of life-cycle decision rules under habit formation, and the implications of the heterogeneity in habit formation coefficients across individuals for the analysis of aggregate consumption are investigated.},

We challenge this evidence, showing that forward-looking behavior as implied by the New Keynesian model of price-setting is widely supported at the sectoral level. in fact, current and expected future values of the income share of intermediate goods emerge as an effective driver of inflation dynamics. Unlike alternative proxies for the forcing variable, the cost of intermediate goods presents dynamic properties in line with the predictions of the New Keynesian theory.},

  abstract      = {This article describes a new clustering method for segmentation of Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain images. Currently, when fuzzy clustering is applied to brain image segmentation, there are two main problems to be solved which are: (i) the sensitivity to noise and intensity non-uniformity (INU) artifact; (ii) the trapping into local minima and dependency on initial clustering centroids. For the purpose of obtaining satisfactory segmentation performance and dealing with the problems mentioned above, an effective method is developed within the scope of this paper. Firstly, a new objective function utilizing kernelized fuzzy entropy clustering with local spatial information and bias correction (KFECSB) is designed. We then propose a new algorithm based on an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) with the new fitness function to better segment MRI brain images. To test its performance, the proposed algorithm has been evaluated on several benchmark images including the simulated MRI brain images from the McConnell Brain Imaging Center (BrainWeb) and the real MRI brain images from the Internet Brain Segmentation Repository (IBSR). In addition, a systematic comparison of the proposed algorithm versus five other state of the art techniques is presented. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve satisfactory performance for images with noise and intensity inhomogeneity, and provide better results than its competitors.},

New tests of the random walk hypothesis are developed which permit a wide class of dependent and heterogeneous innovation sequences.

We discover that when a certain criterion is satisfied by the sample moments, the likelihood function is monotone and {MLE} estimates are infinite, implying an extremely homogeneous region. We implement three corrected estimators in an attempt to obtain finite parameter estimates. Two of the estimators are taken from the literature on monotone likelihood (Firth, 1993; Jeffreys, 1946) and one, based on resampling, is proposed by the authors. We perform Monte Carlo experiments to compare the three estimators. We find the estimator based on the Jeffreys prior to be the worst. The choice between Firth’s estimator and the Bootstrap estimator depends on the value of the number of looks (which is given before estimation) and the specific needs of the user. We also apply the estimators to real data obtained from synthetic aperture radar (SAR). These results corroborate the Monte Carlo findings. Further clarification of the choice between the Firth and Bootstrap estimators will be obtained through future studies of the classification properties of these estimators. },

The radar cross section (RCS) of such targets is usually described in statistical terms using one of the many statistical models that are available.

To better handle this condition, the alpha-stable distribution is shown to model RCS over a wide range of amplitudes. The alpha-stable distribution is derived from the generalized central limit theorem and contains the Gaussian (or Rayleigh) distribution as a subset. The alpha-stable distribution is shown to fit examples of ship RCS as well as sea clutter examples.

We estimate the unknown parameters of the process using three methods of estimation and investigate properties of the estimators with some numerical results to illustrate them.

More refined analysis showed that the failure distribution for each airplane separately was exponential, but with a different failure rate. Using the theorem that a mixture of distributions each having a non-increasing failure rate (e. g., a mixture of exponential distributions) itself has a non-increasing failure rate, the apparent decreasing failure rate of the pooled air-conditioning life distribution was satisfactorily explained. The present study has implications in other areas where an observed decreasing failure rate may well be the result of mixing exponential distributions having different parameters.},

  abstract    = {Empirical ?ndings related to the time series properties of stock returns volatility indicate autocorrelations that decay slowly at long lags. in light of this, several long-memory models have been proposed. However, the possibility of level shifts has been advanced as a possible explanation for the appearance of long-memory and there is growing evidence suggesting that it may be an important feature of stock returns volatility. Nevertheless, it remains a conjecture that a model incorporating random level shifts in variance can explain the data well and produce reasonable forecasts. We show that a very simple stochastic volatility model incorporating both a random level shift and a short-memory component indeed provides a better in-sample fit of the data and produces forecasts that are no worse, and sometimes better, than standard stationary short and long-memory models. We use a Bayesian method for inference and develop algorithms to obtain the posterior distributions of the parameters and the smoothed estimates of the two latent components. We apply the model to daily S\&P 500 and NASDAQ returns over the period 1980.1-2005.12. Although the occurrence of a level shift is rare, about once every two years, the level shift component clearly contributes most to the total variation in the volatility process. The half-life of a typical shock from the short-memory component is very short, on average between 8 and 14 days. We also show that, unlike common stationary short or long-memory models, our model is able to replicate keys features of the data. For the NASDAQ series, it forecasts better than a standard stochastic volatility model, and for the S\&P 500 index, it performs equally well.},

Due to the high variability of urban land-scape and the existing misdetection of buildings as vegetation, urban area extraction is still a challenging problem. In this paper, an eigenvalue-based urban area extraction method is proposed. First, similar to the entropy/anisotropy plane, a two-dimensional RVI/PA plane is put forward to construct the extractor of buildings with small orientation angles. Second, coupled with the parameters, a robust extractor is introduced to elevate the scattering characteristics of buildings with large orientation angles but to suppress those of others. Finally, data-driven thresholds are investigated and ascertained for the extractors, thus urban areas are extracted. In addition, a change detection-based prescreening method is applied to refine the extraction result. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated and validated with spaceborne and airborne fully PolSAR data over different test sites. The outputs show that the proposed method provides an overall accuracy of over 90%, as well as better visual results of the extracted buildings.},

Paper [1], [2] and [3] advance the integer-valued moving average model (INMA), a special case of integer-valued autoregressive moving average (INARMA) model class, and apply the models to the number of stock transactions in intra-day data. Paper [4] focuses on modelling the long memory property of time series of count data and on applying the model in a financial setting. Paper [1] advances the INMA model to model the number of transactions in stocks in intraday data. The conditional mean and variance properties are discussed and model extensions to include, e.g., explanatory variables are offered. Least squares and generalized method of moment estimators are presented. in a small Monte Carlo study a feasible least squares estimator comes out as the best choice. Empirically we find support for the use of long-lag moving average models in a Swedish stock series. There is evidence of asymmetric effects of news about prices on the number of transactions. Paper [2] introduces a bivariate integer-valued moving average (BINMA) model and applies the BINMA model to the number of stock transactions in intra-day data. The BINMA model allows for both positive and negative correlations between the count data series. The study shows that the correlation between series in the BINMA model is always smaller than one in an absolute sense. The conditional mean, variance and covariance are given. Model extensions to include explanatory variables are suggested. Using the BINMA model for AstraZeneca and Ericsson B it is found that there is positive correlation between the stock transactions series. Empirically, we find support for the use of long-lag bivariate moving average models for the two series. Paper [3] introduces a vector integer-valued moving average (VINMA) model. The VINMA model allows for both positive and negative correlations between the counts. The conditional and uncond},

  abstract    = {This paper analyses the time-series behaviour of private health expenditure and GDP to understand whether there is long-term equilibrium relationship between these two variables and estimate income elasticity of private health expenditure. The study uses cointegration analysis with structural breaks and estimates these relationships using FM OLS (fully modified ordinary least squares) method. The findings suggest that income elasticity of private health expenditures is 1.95 indicating that for every one per cent increase in per capita income the private health expenditure has gone up by 1.95 per cent. The private health expenditure was 2.4 per cent of GDP in 1960 and this has risen to 5.8 per cent in 2003. in nominal terms it has grown at the rate of 11.3 per cent since 1960 and during 1990’s the growth rate is 18 per cent per annum. The study discusses four reasons for this high growth experience. These are: (i) financing mechanisms including provider payment system, (ii) demographic trends and epidemiological transition, (iii) production function of private health services delivery system, and (iv) dwindling financing support to public health system. in developing countries where per se the need for spending on health is high, high levels of private health expenditures pose serious challenge to policy makers. The sheer size of these expenditures once it has risen to high levels can impede control of health expenditures itself. The high private health expenditures are also cause of concern because most of these expenditures are out-of-pocket, insurance mechanisms cover small segment of population, provider payment systems are primarily based on fee-for-services and the professional regulation and accountability systems are weak and non-functioning in many ways. It is not clear whether these expenditures are sustainable as it can have number of undesirable consequences making the health system high cost, unaffordable, and vulnerable to provider payment system.},

  abstract  = {The log-logistic distribution (also known as the Fisk distribution in economics) is widely used in survival analysis when the failure rate function presents a unimodal shape. in this paper, we introduce the Zografos- Balakrishnan log-logistic distribution, which contains the log-logistic distribution as a special model and has the four common shapes of the hazard hate function. We present some properties of the new distribution and estimate the model parameters by maximum likelihood. An application to a real data set shows that the new distribution can provide a better fit than other classical lifetime models such as the exponentiated Weibull distribution.},

By compounding the exponentiated Lomax and Poisson distributions, a new continuous distribution is introduced, called the exponentiated Lomax Poisson distribution. The new model extends the Lomax distribution and some other distributions and it is quite flexible to analyze positive data. Various structural properties of the new distribution are derived including explicit expressions for the ordinary and incomplete moments, generating and quantile functions, mean deviations, Lorenz and Bonferroni curves, reliability, R\'enyi and Shannon entropies, order statistics and their moments. The estimation of the model parameters is performed by maximum likelihood. We also determine the observed information matrix.

By examining the dependence of backscattering on standing biomass using backscatter modeling and aircraft data, it was determined, in agreement with other recent reports, that the cross-polarized (HV) data from longer wavelengths (L, P-band) were the best radar channels for mapping total above-ground forest biomass. The radar signal appeared to lose sensitivity to changes in biomass for dry biomass levels beyond about 15 kg/m2 (150 Mton/Ha). The ratio of HV backscattering from two bands, a longer wavelength P (wavelength=68 cm) or L band (24 cm) to a shorter wavelength C band (6 cm), enhanced the correlation of the image signature to standing biomass (r2=0.83 for P/C and r2 =0.79 for L/C) and showed increased sensitivity to dry biomass beyond 15 kg/m2},

A proper diagnosis implies a distinction between cyclical or structural trends based on historical analysis and theoretical results. This article presents the basis of volatility as risk measurement and the difficulties to use it. The authors compare the current volatility of prices and its long term trend. They base their analysis on new theoretical or empirical results. .

  abstract  = {The hazard function is a key component in the inferential process in survival analysis and relevant for describing the pattern of failures. However, it is rarely shown in research papers due to the difficulties in nonparametric estimation. We developed the bshazard package to facilitate the computation of a nonparametric estimate of the hazard function, with data-driven smoothing. The method accounts for left truncation, right censoring and possible covariates. B-splines are used to estimate the shape of the hazard within the generalized linear mixed models framework. Smoothness is controlled by imposing an autoregressive structure on the baseline hazard coefficients. This perspective allows an ‘automatic’ smoothing by avoiding the need to choose the smoothing parameter, which is estimated from the data as a dispersion parameter. A simulation study demonstrates the capability of our software and an application to estimate the hazard of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in Swedish population data shows its potential.},

During the last two decades, the method of maximum likelihood has become the most widely followed approach to this problem, thanks primarily to the advent of high speed electronic computers. Here, we first offer a brief survey of the literature directed toward this problem and review maximum-likelihood estimation for it. We then turn to the subject of ultimate interest, which is a particular iterative procedure for numerically approximating maximum-likelihood estimates for mixture density problems. This procedure, known as the EM algorithm, is a specialization to the mixture density context of a general algorithm of the same name used to approximate maximum-likelihood estimates for incomplete data problems. We discuss the formulation and theoretical and practical properties of the EM algorithm for mixture densities, focussing in particular on mixtures of densities from exponential families.},

The increments of the process follow a generalized normal Laplace (GNL) distribution which exhibits positive kurtosis and can be either symmetrical or exhibit skewness. The degree of kurtosis in the increments increases as the time between observations decreases. This and other properties render Brownian-Laplace motion a good candidate model for the motion of logarithmic stock prices. An option pricing formula for European call options is derived and it is used to calculate numerically the value of such an option both using nominal parameter values (to explore its dependence upon them) and those obtained as estimates from real stock price data. },

  abstract  = {An adaptive smoothing filter is proposed for reducing noise in digital signals of any dimensionality. The adaptive procedure is based on the selection of an appropriate inner or outer trimmed mean filter according to local measurements of the tail behavior (impulsivity) of the noise process. The set of trimmed means used provides robustness against a wide range of noise possibilities ranging from very shallow tailed to very heavy tailed. A Monte Carlo analysis using a family of generalized exponential distributions supports the choice of the trimmed mean selected for measured values of an impulsivity statistic. The assumption underlying the definition of the filter is that the signal to be filtered is locally smoothly varying, and that the noise process is uncorrelated and derives from an unknown, unimodal symmetric distribution. For image-processing applications, a second statistic is used to mark the location of abrupt intensity changes, or edges; in the vicinity of an edge, the trend-preserving median filter is used. Since the impulsivity and edge statistics used in defining the adaptive filter are both functions of order statistics, the extra computation required for their calculation is minimal. Examples are provided of the filter as applied to images corrupted by a variety of noises},

  abstract  = { Financial market time series exhibit high degrees of non-linear variability, and frequently have fractal properties. When the fractal dimension of a time series is non-integer, this is associated with two features: (1) inhomogeneity-extreme fluctuations at irregular intervals, and (2) scaling symmetries-proportionality relationships between fluctuations over different separation distances. in multivariate systems such as financial markets, fractality is stochastic rather than deterministic, and generally originates as a result of multiplicative interactions. Volatility diffusion models with multiple stochastic factors can generate fractal structures. in some cases, such as exchange rates, the underlying structural equation also gives rise to fractality. Fractal principles can be used to develop forecasting algorithms. The forecasting method that yields the best results here is the state transition-fitted residual scale ratio (ST-FRSR) model. A state transition model is used to predict the conditional probability of extreme events. Ratios of rates of change at proximate separation distances are used to parameterize the scaling symmetries. Forecasting experiments are run using intraday exchange rate futures contracts measured at 15-minute intervals. The overall forecast error is reduced on average by up to 7\% and in one instance by nearly a quarter. However, the forecast error during the outlying events is reduced by 39\% to 57\%. The ST-FRSR reduces the predictive error primarily by capturing extreme fluctuations more accurately. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The new density function contains as special cases many models that have been proposed recently in the literature. in constructing this model, we assume that the number of competing causes of the event of interest has a general discrete distribution characterized by its probability generating function. This function has an important role in the selection procedure as well as in computing the conditional personal cure rate.

A new version of the modified Gompertz model and the promotion cure rate model that takes into account the first passage time of reaching the critical point are discussed, and the estimation of tumor size at detection is then addressed from the Bayesian viewpoint. in addition, a simulation study and an application to real data set illustrate the usefulness of the proposed cure rate model.},

It is proved that the well-known Mittag-Leffler relaxation function (Berberan-Santos, ) is a simple way to obtain a new cure rate model that is a compromise between the promotion and geometric cure rate models allowing for superdispersion. So, the relaxed cure rate model developed here can be considered as a natural and less restrictive extension of the popular Poisson cure rate model at the cost of an additional parameter, but a competitor to negative-binomial cure rate models (Rodrigues et al., ). Some mathematical properties of a proper relaxed Poisson density are explored. A simulation study and an illustration of the proposed cure rate model from the Bayesian point of view are finally presented.},

Using the ultrahigh-frequency data of a liquid Chinese stock and its associated warrant, we perform a comparative investigation of the statistical properties of their intertrade duration time series. The distributions of the two equities can be better described by the shifted power-law form than the Weibull form, and their scaled distributions do not collapse onto a single curve. Although the intertrade durations of the two equities have very different magnitude, their intraday patterns exhibit very similar shapes. Both detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and detrending moving average analysis (DMA) show that the 1 min intertrade duration time series of the two equities are strongly correlated. in addition, both multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) and multifractal detrending moving average analysis (MFDMA) unveil that the 1 min intertrade durations possess multifractal nature. However, the difference between the two singularity spectra of the two equities obtained from the MFDMA is much smaller than that from the MFDFA.},

Despite some overlap with the author's undergraduate textbook Statistics and Finance: An Introduction, this book differs from that earlier volume in several important aspects: it is graduate-level; computations and graphics are done in R; and many advanced topics are covered, for example, multivariate distributions, copulas, Bayesian computations, VaR and expected shortfall, and cointegration. The prerequisites are basic statistics and probability, matrices and linear algebra, and calculus. Some exposure to finance is helpful.

  abstract  = {Volatility of the financial time series belongs to the crucial estimated parameters in finance (e.g. in risk management, derivative pricing). It is well known, that volatility varies in time, so that new approaches of volatility modeling have appeared. in this paper two models of the conditional heteroskedasticity - fractionally integrated GARCH (FIGARCH) and EWMA are presented. These models are illustrated on the daily historical returns of stock index PX and index BUX. Standard tests of normality, autocorrelation and conditional heteroskedasticity are applied to these log-return time series and before estimating the models, which confirm a usability of the conditional heteroskedasticity models. Empirical results of the Rescale Range analysis (R/S) indicate a long memory in the volatility process of PX index and the first 40 autocorrelations of the square log-returns show their hyperbolic decay. The volatility models are estimated by quasi-maximum likelihood method with Student´s t-distribution and used to the calculation of the 1-day 95\% and 99\% Value at Risk values. Finally, the validity of the models is verified by Kupiec´s test, TUFF and Christoffersen´s test. These tests demonstrate, that the FIGARCH model is a suitable alternative to the EWMA model in the Value at Risk calculation.},

Based on the log-logistic and Kumaraswamy distributions, we introduce the called Kumaraswamy-log-logistic distribution. The new distribution contains several important distributions discussed in the literature as sub-models such as the log-logistic, exponentiated log-logistic and Burr XII distributions, among several others. The beauty and importance of the new distribution lies in its ability to model non-monotonic failure rate functions, which are quite common in lifetime data analysis and reliability. Some of its structural properties are studied. We propose the Kumaraswamy-logistic regression model which has, as sub-models, various widely-known regression models. We discuss the method of maximum likelihood to estimate the model parameters and determine the observed information matrix. Two real data sets illustrate the importance and flexibility of the proposed models.},

  abstract  = {Three braided rivers of different scales and different hydrologic/geomorphologic characteristics (the Aichilik and Hulahula in Alaska and the Brahmaputra in Bangladesh) are analyzed for spatial scaling using a logarithmic correlation integral method developed earlier by the authors. It is shown that the rivers exhibit anisotropic scaling (self-affinity) with fractal exponents vx = 0.72–0.74 and vy = 0.51-0.52, the x axis being oriented along the river and the y axis in the perpendicular direction. The fact that despite large differences in scales (0.5–15 km in braid plain width), slopes (7 × 10−3 to 8 × 10−5), and types of bed material (gravel to sand), the analyzed braided rivers show similar spatial scaling deserves special attention. It might indicate the presence of universal features in the underlying mechanisms responsible for the formation of the spatial structure of braided rivers. Also, comparison of fractal characteristics of braided rivers with those of single-channel rivers and river networks suggests that braided rivers form a class of fractal objects lying between the classes of single-channel rivers and river networks.},

Another generalization of the linear exponential was introduced by Sarhan and Kundu [1,2], named as the generalized linear failure rate distribution. This paper proposes a more generalization of the linear exponential distribution which generalizes the two. We refer to this new generalization as the exponentiated generalized linear exponential distribution. The new distribution is important since it contains as special sub-models some widely well known distributions in addition to the above two models, such as the exponentiated Weibull distribution among many others. It also provides more flexibility to analyze complex real data sets. We study some statistical properties for the new distribution. We discuss maximum likelihood estimation of the distribution parameters. Three real data sets are analyzed using the new distribution, which show that the exponentiated generalized linear exponential distribution can be used quite effectively in analyzing real lifetime data.},

  abstract  = {A new method for performing a nonlinear form of principal component analysis is proposed. By the use of integral operator kernel functions, one can efficiently compute principal components in high-dimensional feature spaces, related to input space by some nonlinear map—for instance, the space of all possible five-pixel products in 16 × 16 images. We give the derivation of the method and present experimental results on polynomial feature extraction for pattern recognition.},

In particular, we consider the case of mixture of mixture models with varying parametrization which allow for parsimonious models. The approach is an extension of an existing work on reducing dimensionality for model-based clustering based on Gaussian mixtures. Information on the dimension reduction subspace is provided by the variation on class locations and, depending on the estimated mixture model, on the variation on class dispersions. Projections along the estimated directions provide summary plots which help to visualize the structure of the classes and their characteristics. A suitable modification of the method allows us to recover the most discriminant directions, i.e., those that show maximal separation among classes. The approach is illustrated using simulated and real data.},

Information on the dimension reduction subspace is obtained from the variation on group means and, depending on the estimated mixture model, on the variation on group covariances. The proposed method aims at reducing the dimensionality by identifying a set of linear combinations, ordered by importance as quantified by the associated eigenvalues, of the original features which capture most of the cluster structure contained in the data. Observations may then be projected onto such a reduced subspace, thus providing summary plots which help to visualize the clustering structure. These plots can be particularly appealing in the case of high-dimensional data and noisy structure. The new constructed variables capture most of the clustering information available in the data, and they can be further reduced to improve clustering performance. We illustrate the approach on both simulated and real data sets.},

The authors proved that GM algorithms, based on a geometrical approach, are more accurate than classical algorithms, especially with short length time series. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a mathematical background for the validity of these two algorithms to calculate the Hurst exponent HH of random processes with stationary and self-affine increments. in particular, we show that these procedures are valid not only for exploring long memory in classical processes such as (fractional) Brownian motions, but also for estimating the Hurst exponent of (fractional) L\'evy stable motions.},

  abstract  = {The detection of long range dependence (LRD) is an important task in time series analysis. LRD is often summarized by the well-known Hurst parameter (or exponent) H∈[0,1], which can be estimated by a number of methods. Some of these techniques are designed to be applied to signals behaving as a stationary fractional Gaussian noise (fGn), whereas others imply that the analyzed time series behave as a non-stationary fractional Brownian motion (fBm). Moreover, some estimators do not yield the Hurst parameter but indexes related to H and ranging outside the unit interval. Therefore, the fGn or fBm nature of the studied time series has to be preliminarily analyzed before applying any estimation method, and the relationships between H and the indexes resulting from the analyses have to be taken into account to obtain coherent results. Since fGn-like series represent the increments of fBm-like processes and both the signals are characterized by the same H value by definition, estimators designed for fGn-like series can be applied to fBm-like sequences after preventive differentiation, and conversely estimators designed for fBm-like processes can be applied to fGn-like series after preventive integration. The signal characterization is particularly important when H is estimated on financial time series because the returns represent the first difference of price time series, which are often assumed to behave like self-affine sequences. The analysis of simulated fGn and fBm time series shows that all the considered methods yield comparable H values when properly applied. The reanalysis of several market price time series already studied in the literature points out that a correct application of the estimators (supported by a preventive signal classification) yields homogeneous H values allowing for a useful cross-validation of results reported in different works. Moreover, some conclusions reported in the literature about the anti-persistence of some financial series are shown to be incorrect because of the inappropriate application of the estimation methods.},

The compounding procedure follows the same set-up carried out by Adamidis and Loukas [A lifetime distribution with decreasing failure rate. Stat Probab Lett. 1998;39:35–42]. We provide mathematical properties of this new distribution such as moments, estimation by maximum likelihood with censored data, inference for a large sample and the EM algorithm to determine the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters. Furthermore, we characterize the proposed distributions using a simple relationship between two truncated moments and maximum entropy principle under suitable constraints. Finally, to show the flexibility of this type of distributions, we demonstrate applications of two real data sets.},

We show that such maps can lead on the one hand to tractable mechanisms for the introduction of skewness into a symmetric distribution, without the pathology of Gram-Charlier expansions, and on the other hand to practical methods for converting samples from one distribution into those from another, without the limitations of CornishFisher expansions. These maps have many applications in mathematical finance and statistics generally, including the assessment of distributional risk in pricing and risk calculations. We give examples of skewuniform, skew-normal and skew-exponential distributions based on these techniques, suggest kurtotic variations, and also describe accurate methods for converting samples from the normal distribution into samples from the Student distributions or for converting one Student distribution into another.},

Neither was there any indication of the presence of a liquidity trap. Possible sources of discrepancy are explored and the diametrically opposite results between the aggregate and disaggregate analysis are attributed to the neglected heterogeneity among micro units. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a cointegrating relation among aggregate variables when heterogeneous cointegration relations among micro units exist. We also conduct simulation analysis to show that when such conditions are violated, it is possible to observe stable micro relations, but unit root phenomena among macro variables. Moreover, the prediction of aggregate outcomes, using aggregate data, is less accurate than the prediction based on micro equations, and policy evaluation based on aggregate data ignoring heterogeneity in micro units can be grossly misleading.

First, if a time series follows an I(d) process, then each subsample of the time series also follows an I(d) process with the same value of d. Second, if a time series follows an I(d) process, then its dth differenced series follows an I(0) process. Simple as they may sound, these properties provide useful tools to distinguish between true and spurious I(d) processes. in the first test, we split the sample into b subsamples, estimate d for each subsample, and compare them with the estimate of d from the full sample. in the second test, we estimate d, use the estimate to take the dth difference of the sample, and apply the KPSS test and Phillips-Perron test to the differenced data and its partial sum. Both tests are applicable to both stationary and nonstationary I(d) processes. Simulations show that the proposed tests have good power against the spurious long memory models considered in the literature. The tests are applied to the daily realized volatility of the S\&P 500 index.},

  abstract  = {Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) is in operational use for spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-based deformation analysis. A limitation inherently associated with PSI is that, by definition, a persistent scatterer (PS) is a single dominant scatterer. Therefore, pixels containing signal contributions from multiple scatterers, as in the case of a layover, are typically rejected in the PSI processing, which in turn limits deformation retrieval. SAR tomography has the ability to resolve layovers. This paper investigates the added value that can be achieved by operationally combining SAR tomography with a PSI approach toward the objective of improving deformation sampling in layover-affected urban areas. Different tomographic phase models are implemented and compared as regards their suitability in resolving layovers. Single-look beamforming-based tomographic inversion and a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT)-based detection strategy are used to detect single and double scatterers. The quantity of the detected scatterers is weighed against their quality as defined in terms of the phase deviation between the single-look complex (SLC) measurements and the tomographic model fit. The gain in deformation sampling that can be derived with tomography relative to a PSI-based analysis is quantitatively assessed, and alongside the quality of the scatterers obtained with tomography is compared with the quality of the PSs identified with a PSI approach. The experiments are performed on an interferometric stack of 50 TerraSAR-X stripmap images. The results obtained show that, although there is a tradeoff between the quantity and the quality of the detected scatterers, the tested SAR tomography approach leads to an improvement in deformation sampling in layover-affected areas.},

Assuming censored data, we consider a classic analysis, a Bayesian analysis and a jackknife estimator for the parameters of the proposed model. For different parameter settings, sample sizes and censoring percentages, various simulation studies are performed and compared to the performance of the log-logistic and log-Burr XII regression models. Besides, we use sensitivity analysis to detect influential or outlying observations, and residual analysis is used to check the assumptions in the model. Finally, we analyze a real data set under log-Burr XII regression models.},

  abstract  = {A bathtub-shaped failure rate function is very useful in survival analysis and reliability studies. The well-known lifetime distributions do not have this property. For the first time, we propose a location-scale regression model based on the logarithm of an extended Weibull distribution which has the ability to deal with bathtub-shaped failure rate functions. We use the method of maximum likelihood to estimate the model parameters and some inferential procedures are presented. We reanalyze a real data set under the new model and the log-modified Weibull regression model. We perform a model check based on martingale-type residuals and generated envelopes and the statistics A I C and B I C to select appropriate models.},

These residuals can also be used for the log-logistic regression model, which is a special case of the log-Burr XII regression model. For different parameter settings, sample sizes and censoring percentages, various simulation studies are performed and the empirical distribution of each residual is displayed and compared with the standard normal distribution. These studies suggest that the residual analysis usually performed in normal linear regression models can be straightforwardly extended to the modified martingale-type residual in log-Burr XII regression models with censored data.},

Some mathematical properties of the new family are studied including moments and generating function. Three special models are investigated in details. Maximum likelihood estimation of the unknown parameters for complete sample is discussed. Two applications of the new models to real data are performed for illustrative purposes.},

The maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) of the two parameter gamma distribution are known to be biased, and bias-corrected estimators of the parameters are available in the literature. In this paper, we have used Monte-Carlo simulation to estimate the bias and mean squared error (MSE) of the moment estimators, the ML estimators, and bias-corrected ML estimators. Our simulations show that the bias-correction available in the literature fails to remove the bias in the MLE for small values of the shape parameter.},

The maximum likelihood estimates along with their standard errors and confidence intervals have been obtained. For Bayesian estimation, we use independent gamma priors for the model parameters. The posterior densities of the parameters are simulated using Metropolis--Hastings algorithm to obtain sample-based estimates and highest posterior density intervals. Applications of the proposed distribution to three real data sets have been demonstrated.},

Here θ and other parameters, which may or may not include α and c, are unknown. The classical regularity conditions for the asymptotic properties of maximum likelihood estimators are not satisfied but it is shown that, when $\alpha > 2$, the information matrix is finite and the classical asymptotic properties continue to hold. For α = 2 the maximum likelihood estimators are asymptotically efficient and normally distributed, but with a different rate of convergence. For $1 < \alpha < 2$, the maximum likelihood estimators exist in general, but are not asymptotically normal, while the question of asymptotic efficiency is still unsolved. For α ⩽ 1, the maximum likelihood estimators may not exist at all, but alternatives are proposed. All these results are already known for the case of a single unknown location parameter θ, but are here extended to the case in which there are additional unknown parameters. The paper concludes with a discussion of the applications in extreme value theory.},

  abstract  = {R\'enyi information of order λ for a continuous random variable is considered and its connection to the loglikelihood is established. From this relation, an intrinsic loglikelihood-based distribution measure Sf is proposed. It is derived from the gradient of the spectrum of R\'enyi information and it can be represented, in the case of important parametric families, by a single function – the trigamma function. Serving as a measure of the shape of a distribution, Sf can be used to compare the tails and shapes of various frequently used densities, whereas the traditional kurtosis measure is not applicable, including many heavy-tailed distributions such as Student's t with any degree of freedom, Cauchy, Cram\'er, L\'evy and Pareto distributions. A nonparametric procedure of estimating the measure Sf is also developed and its strong consistency is established. },

  abstract  = {This paper concerns a generalization of the gamma distribution, the specific form being suggested by Liouville's extension to Dirichlet's integral formula [3]. in this form it also may be regarded as a special case of a function introduced by L. Amoroso [1] and R. d'Addario [2] in analyzing the distribution of economic income. (Also listed in [4] and [5].) in essence, the generalization (1) herein is accomplished by supplying a positive parameter, p, as an exponent in the exponential factor of the gamma distribution. The moment generating function is shown, and cumulative probabilities are related directly to the incomplete gamma function (tabulated in [6]). Distributions are given for various functions of independent "generalized gamma variates" thus defined, special attention being given to the sum of such variates. Convolution results occur in alternating series form, with coefficients whose evaluation may be tedious and lengthy. An upper bound is provided for the modulus of each term, and simplified computation methods are developed for some special cases. A corollary is derived showing that the researches of Robbins in [7] apply to a larger class of problems than was treated in [7]. Extensions of his methods lead to iterative formulae for the coefficients in series obtained for an even larger class of problems.},

Variables such as stock returns, share volume, and number of trades have been found to display distributions that are consistent with a power-law tail. We present an overview of recent research joining practitioners of economic theory and statistical physics to try to understand better some puzzles regarding economic fluctuations. One of these puzzles is how to describe outliers, i.e. phenomena that lie outside of patterns of statistical regularity. We review recent research, which suggests that such outliers may not in fact exist and that the same laws seem to govern outliers as well as day-to-day fluctuations.},

  abstract      = {Interest in log-linear modeling for social-network data has grown steadily since Holland and Leinhardt (1981) proposed their p1 model. That model was designed for a single binary relationship (directed graph) representing interactions between individuals. It assumed that interactions between pairs of individuals are mutually independent. Subsequent work has extended the model in various ways, including block-modeling and the case of dependence between pairs of individuals. in empirical work it would often be desirable to fit a wide variety of these models, as the differences in predictions or goodness of fit are likely to provide insights into the data. This has not been common practice, however, because estimation for some of the models has been difficult, and the maximum likelihood schemes developed for others involve different computer programs not always available in standard packages. The focus of this article is on a general estimation technique that maximizes the pseudolikelihood, the product of the probabilities of the binary variables, with each probability conditional on the rest of the data. The method is shown to be equivalent to a weighted least squares procedure and thus can be carried out with standard computer packages. in cases where true maximum likelihood estimation is available for comparison the two methods seem to work about equally well. The pseudolikelihood estimation is used in an example where the fits of a large number of different models are compared. Some of these models, such as various Markov block models, have not previously been proposed. in this example (as in others considered) it appears that the p1-type models are overparameterized, and that much more parsimonious models give tolerable fits.},

Order statistics arise naturally in many of such applications. in this paper, we derive the exact explicit expressions for the single, double (product), triple and quadruple moments of order statistics from the Lindley distribution. Then, we use these moments to obtain the best linear unbiased estimates (BLUEs) of the location and scale parameters based on Type-II right-censored samples. Next, we use these results to determine the mean, variance, and coefficients of skewness and kurtosis of some certain linear functions of order statistics to develop Edgeworth approximate confidence intervals of the location and scale Lindley parameters. in addition, we carry out some numerical illustrations through Monte Carlo simulations to show the usefulness of the findings. Finally, we apply the findings of the paper to some real data set. },

Speckle removal adds an extra value to an automated SAR image interpretation and analysis. in this paper, dual-tree complex wavelet-transform-based Bayesian method is proposed for despeckling the SAR images. in each subband, the reflectance and noise of the logarithmically transformed wavelet coefficients are modeled using heavy-tailed Burr and zero-mean Gaussian distributions. The closed-form expression for the shape parameter of Burr distribution is derived by employing the Mellin transform. The resultant complex-free quadratic maximum a posteriori solution with suitable shrinkage function yields despeckled SAR images. Extensive experiments are carried out using real SAR images as well as simulated images. The proposed method performs well in terms of equivalent number of looks with 3.5751 dB improvement in homogeneous region1 of Pipe river SAR image, edge preservation with 0.6158 improvement, peak signal to noise ratio of 51.3305 dB, and mean structural similarity index measure of 0.9397 at 0.05 noise variance for synthetically speckled image in comparison to the existing methods and takes averagely 2.3461 times less computing time. The proposed method provides a computationally efficient better speckle reduction in homogeneous regions while still preserving the edge.},

This study focuses on the problem of estimating the parameters of a newly developed 3-component mixture of Burr Type-XII distributions using Type-I right censored data. Firstly, considering a Bayesian structure, some mathematical properties of a 3-component mixture of Burr Type-XII distributions are discussed. These mathematical properties include Bayes estimators and posterior risks for the unknown component and proportion parameters using the non-informative and the informative priors under squared error loss function, precautionary loss function and DeGroot loss function. Secondly, in case when no or little prior information is available, elicitation of hyperparameters is given. Also, the posterior predictive distribution for a future observation and the Bayesian predictive interval are constructed. Moreover, the limiting expressions for the Bayes estimators and posterior risks are derived. In addition, the performance of the Bayes estimators for different sample sizes, test termination times and parametric values under different loss functions is investigated. Finally, simulated datasets are designed for the different comparisons and the model is illustrated using the real data.},

This paper aims about studying the problem of estimating the parameters of a 3-component mixture of Exponential, Rayleigh and Burr Type-XII distributions using type-I right censoring scheme in Bayesian framework. The elegant closed form expressions for the Bayes estimators and their variances using the non-informative and the informative priors are derived for censored sample as well as for complete sample. The hyperparameters are elicited using prior predictive distribution when no or little prior information is available. The posterior predictive distribution with different priors is derived and the equations necessary to find the lower and upper limits of the Bayesian predictive intervals are constructed. A detailed simulation study is carried out to investigate the performance (in terms of variances) of the Bayes estimators. Finally, the model is illustrated using the real life data.

The generalization through induction of shape parameter(s) started in 1997, and the last two decades were full of such practices. But to cope with the complex situations under series and parallel structures, the art of mixing discrete and continuous started in 1998. in this article, we present a survey on compounding univariate distributions, their extensions and classes. We review several available compound classes and propose some new ones. The recent trends in the construction of generalized and compounding classes are discussed, and the need for future works are addressed.},

Further, it can be expressed as a linear combination of exponentiated densities based on the same baseline distribution. We derive explicit expressions for the ordinary and incomplete moments, quantile and generating functions, Bonferroni and Lorenz curves, Shannon entropy and order statistics. The model parameters are estimated by the method of maximum likelihood and the observed information matrix is determined. We also investigate the properties of one special model, the logistic-Fr\'echet distribution, and illustrate its importance by means of two applications to real data sets. },

This model can have flexible hazard rate shapes such as increasing, decreasing, bathtub and upside-down bathtub. The method of maximum likelihood is used to estimate the model parameters.

  abstract    = { Long memory models have been successfully used to investigate the dynamic time-series behavior of inflation rates based on the CPI and WPI. However, almost no attention has been paid to import and export price inflation, nor to the terms of trade which they make up. This article investigates the dynamics of the terms of trade by focusing first on the time-series characteristics of these price series. It tests for long memory in export and import price inflation series and estimates the fractional differencing parameter using a number of approaches. To give a better idea of the degree of persistence of each series, estimates of the impulse responses are computed which take into account possible fractional integration. The dynamic behavior in changes in the terms of trade is then related to the long memory behavior of the import and export price inflation series. in a sample of eleven economies for which data is available, evidence of long memory in import and export price inflation occurs in about half the cases. Granger (1980) points out that the natural occurrence of long memory may be attributed to aggregation in macroeconomic series. Our analysis provides evidence of an alternative explanation, namely that long-memory may result from the differencing of a linear relationship between non-cointegrating variables. Specifically, the results from our analysis of eleven economies reveal that shocks to the terms of trade will persist if the constituent price inflation series are not cointegrated},

The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs{\textemdash}30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers{\textemdash}a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

Econometrica 59, 1279–1313, as a test for long-range dependence with good robustness properties under ‘extra’ short-range dependence. in contrast to the classical R/S statistic that uses the standard deviation S to normalize the rescaled range R, Lo's modified R/S-statistic Vq is normalized by a modified standard deviation Sq which takes into account the covariances of the first q lags, so as to discount the influence of the short-range dependence structure that might be present in the data. Depending on the value of the resulting test-statistic Vq, the null hypothesis of no long-range dependence is either rejected or accepted. By performing Monte-Carlo simulations with ‘truly’ long-range- and short-range dependent time series, we study the behavior of Vq, as a function of q, and uncover a number of serious drawbacks to using Lo's method in practice. For example, we show that as the truncation lag q increases, the test statistic Vq has a strong bias toward accepting the null hypothesis (i.e., no long-range dependence), even in ideal situations of ‘purely’ long-range dependent data.},

For these models, longrange dependence in asset price volatility is the consequence of swings in opinions and herding behavior of market participants, which generate switches in the heteroskedastic structure of asset prices. Thus, the observed long-memory in asset prices volatility might be the outcome of a change-point in the conditional variance process, a conclusion supported by a wavelet analysis of the volatility series. This explains why volatility processes share only the properties of the second moments of long-memory processes, but not the properties of the first moments.},

  abstract    = {We consider two multivariate long-memory ARCH models, which extend the univariate long-memory ARCH models, we first consider a long-memory extension of the restricted constant conditional correlations (CCC) model introduced by Bollerslev (1990), and we propose a new unrestricted conditional covariance matrix model which models the conditional covariances as long-memory ARCH processes. We apply these two models to two daily returns on foreign exchanges (FX) rates series, the Pound-US dollar, and the Deutschmark-US dollar. The estimation results for both models show: (i) that the unrestricted model outperforms the restricted CCC model, and (ii) that all the elements of the conditional covariance matrix share the same degree of long-memory for the period April 1979 - January 1997. However, this result does not hold for the floating periods March 1973 - January 1997 and September 1971 - January 1997. This break in the long-term structure may be caused by the European Monetary System inception in March 1979. --},

The SAR data, after calibration, were analyzed together with ground data collected on forest stands from a young stage (eight years) to a mature stage (46 years). The dynamic range of the radar backscatter intensity from forest was found to be greatest at P-band and decreased with increasing frequencies. Cross-polarized backscatter intensity yielded the best sensitivities to variations of forest biomass. L-band data confirmed past results on good correlation with forest parameters. The most striking observation was the strong correlation of P-band backscatter intensity to forest biomass},

More specifically, our aim was to test the procedure proposed by Wagenmakers, Farrell and Ratcliff (2005), and to compare the results obtained with the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayes Information Criterion (BIC). The present studies show that ARFIMA modelling is able to adequately detect long-range dependence in simulated fractal series. Conversely, this method tends to produce a non-negligible rate of false detections in pure ARMA series. Generally, ARFIMA modelling presents a bias favouring the detection of long-range dependence. AIC and BIC gave dissimilar results, due to the different weights attributed by the two criteria to accuracy and parsimony. Finally, ARFIMA modelling provides good estimates of fractal exponents, and could adequately complement classical methods, such as spectral analysis, detrended fluctuation analysis or rescaled range analysis.},

  abstract      = { We propose autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (GARCH) models driven by asymmetric Laplace (AL) noise. The AL distribution plays, in the geometric-stable class, the analogous role played by the normal in the alpha-stable class, and has shown promise in the modelling of certain types of financial and engineering data. in the case of an ARMA model we derive the marginal distribution of the process, as well as its bivariate distribution when separated by a finite number of lags. The calculation of exact confidence bands for minimum mean-squared error linear predictors is shown to be straightforward. Conditional maximum likelihood-based inference is advocated, and corresponding asymptotic results are discussed. The models are particularly suited for processes that are skewed, peaked, and leptokurtic, but which appear to have some higher order moments. A case study of a fund of real estate returns reveals that AL noise models tend to deliver a superior fit with substantially less parameters than normal noise counterparts, and provide both a competitive fit and a greater degree of numerical stability with respect to other skewed distributions. },

  abstract  = {A multiplicative model was used to relate the image variance for a given land-use category to the individual variances associated with image speckle and target texture. Speckle was treated as a random process governed by signal fading and was considered to be statistically independent of the textural variations associated with the spatial variations of the scattering properties of visually "uniform" distributed targets. Seasat SAR imagery of Oklahoma was used to evaluate the textural autocorrelation function of five land-use categories: water, forest, pasture, urban, and cultivated. It was found that the maximum classification accuracy achievable using first-order statistics was 72 percent and that this level of accuracy was obtainable only by significantly degrading the spatial resolution in order to increase the number of independent samples per pixel. in contrast, second-order statistics-specifically, image contrast and inverse moment-provided a classification accuracy of 88 percent, with only a modest degradation in spatial resolution. A second study using SIR-A imagery of five forested regions has shown that the use of textural information can improve the classification accuracy among the five forest types from 75 to 93 percent.},

  abstract      = {Abstract The Michigan Microwave Canopy Scattering model (MIMICS) is based on a first-order solution of the radiative-transfer equation for a tree canopy comprising a crown layer, a trunk layer and a rough-surface ground boundary. The crown layer is modelled in terms of distributions of dielectric cylinders (representing needles and/or branches) and discs (representing leaves), and the trunks are treated as dielectric cylinders of uniform diameter. This report describes MIMICS I, which pertains to tree canopies with horizontally continuous (closed) crowns. The model, which is intended for use in the 0·5-10GHz region at angles greater than 10° from normal incidence, is formulated in terms of a 4 × 4 Stokes-like transformation matrix from which the backscattering coefficient can be computed for any transmit/receive polarization configuration.},

  abstract  = {The d-dimensional fractional Brownian motion (FBM for short) Bt=((Bt(1), …, Bt(d)), t∈ℝ) with Hurst exponent alpha, alpha∈(0, 1), is a d-dimensional centered, self-similar Gaussian process with covariance ${\mathbb{E}}[B_{s}^{(i)}B_{t}^{(j)}]=\frac{1}{2}\delta_{i,j}(|s|^{2\alpha}+|t|^{2\alpha}-|t-s|^{2\alpha})$. The long-standing problem of defining a stochastic integration with respect to FBM (and the related problem of solving stochastic differential equations driven by FBM) has been addressed successfully by several different methods, although in each case with a restriction on the range of either d or alpha. The case alpha=½ corresponds to the usual stochastic integration with respect to Brownian motion, while most computations become singular when alpha gets under various threshhold values, due to the growing irregularity of the trajectories as alpha→0. We provide here a new method valid for any d and for alpha>¼ by constructing an approximation Γ(ɛ)t, ɛ→0, of FBM which allows to define iterated integrals, and then applying the geometric rough path theory. The approximation relies on the definition of an analytic process Γz on the cut plane z∈ℂ∖ℝ of which FBM appears to be a boundary value, and allows to understand very precisely the well-known (see [5]) but as yet a little mysterious divergence of L\'evy’s area for alpha→¼.},

Therefore we conclude that Bitcoin in an inefficient market but may be in the process of moving towards an efficient market.},

Statist. Theory Methods 39 (2010), pp. 3739–3755]. This class of models is an alternative means of analysing positive, continuous and skewed data and, due to its statistical properties, is very competitive with gamma regression models. First, we show that the Weibull model induces ma-ximum likelihood estimators asymptotically more efficient than the gamma model. Standardized residuals are defined, and their statistical properties are examined empirically. Some measures are derived based on the case-deletion model, including the generalized Cook's distance and measures for identifying influential observations on partial F-tests. The results of a simulation study conducted to assess behaviour of the global influence approach are also presented. Further, we perform a local influence analysis under the case-weights, response and explanatory variables perturbation schemes. The Weibull, gamma and other Weibull-type regression models are fitted into three data sets to illustrate the proposed diagnostic tools. Statistical analyses indicate that the Weibull model fitted into these data yields better fits than other common alternative models.},

  abstract  = {A real-valued process X=(X(t))t∈ℝ is self-similar with exponent H(H-ss), if X(a⋅)=daHX for all a>0. Sample path properties of H-ss processes with stationary increments are investigated. The main result is that the sample paths have nowhere bounded variation if 0<H≤1, unless X(t)≡tX(1) and H=1, and apart from this can have locally bounded variation only for H>1, in which case they are singular. However, nowhere bounded variation may occur also for H>1. Examples exhibiting this combination of properties are constructed, as well as many others. Most are obtained by subordination of random measures to point processes in ℝ2 that are Poincare, i.e., invariant in distribution for the transformations (t,x)↦(at+b,ax) of ℝ2. in a final section it is shown that the self-similarity and stationary increment properties are preserved under composition of independent processes: X1∘X2=(X1(X2(t)))t∈ℝ. Some interesting examples are obtained this way.},

  abstract  = {The 2008 financial crisis had scattered incredulity around the globe regarding traditional financial systems, which made investors and non-financial customers turn to other alternative such as digital banking systems. The existence and development of blockchain technology make cryptocurrency in recent years believably become a complete alternative to traditional ones. Bitcoin is the world's first peer-to-peer and decentralized digital cash system initiated by Nakamoto [1]. Though being the most prominent cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has not been a legal trading currency in various countries. Its exchange rate has appeared to be an exceptionally high-risk portfolio with extreme volatility, which requires a more detailed evaluation before making any decision. This paper utilizes knowledge of statistics for financial time series and machine learning to (i) fit the parametric distribution and (ii) model and forecast the volatility of Bitcoin returns, and (iii) analyze its correlation to other financial market indicators. The fitted parametric time series model significantly outperforms other standard models in explaining the stylized facts and statistical variances in the behavior of Bitcoin returns. The model forecast also outperforms some machine learning methodologies, which would benefit policy makers, banks and financial investors in trading activities for both long-term and short-term strategies.},

  abstract  = {This paper describes an improved Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) ship detection algorithm in spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image based on Alpha-stable distribution model. Typically, the CFAR algorithm uses the Gaussian distribution model to describe statistical characteristics of a SAR image background clutter. However, the Gaussian distribution is only valid for multilook SAR images when several radar looks are averaged. As sea clutter in SAR images shows spiky or heavy-tailed characteristics, the Gaussian distribution often fails to describe background sea clutter. in this study, we replace the Gaussian distribution with the Alpha-stable distribution, which is widely used in impulsive or spiky signal processing, to describe the background sea clutter in SAR images. in our proposed algorithm, an initial step for detecting possible ship targets is employed. Then, similar to the typical two-parameter CFAR algorithm, a local process is applied to the pixel identified as possible target. A RADARSAT-1 image is used to validate this Alpha-stable distribution based algorithm. Meanwhile, known ship location data during the time of RADARSAT-1 SAR image acquisition is used to validate ship detection results. Validation results show improvements of the new CFAR algorithm based on the Alpha-stable distribution over the CFAR algorithm based on the Gaussian distribution.},

We show that an ARFIMA process subject to a mean shift and a change in the long memory parameter can be well approximated by an autoregressive (AR) model and suggest using an information criterion (AIC or Mallows’ Cp) to choose the order of the approximate AR model. Our method avoids the issue of estimation inaccuracy of the long memory parameter and the issue of spurious breaks in finite sample. Insights from our theoretical analysis are confirmed by Monte Carlo experiments, through which we also find that our method provides a substantial improvement over existing prediction methods. An empirical application to the realized volatility of three exchange rates illustrates the usefulness of our forecasting procedure. The empirical success of the HAR-RV model can be explained, from an econometric perspective, by our theoretical and simulation results.},

  abstract = {We choice the yuan exchange rate index based on a basket of currencies as the effective exchange rate of the yuan and investigate the statistical properties of the yuan exchange rate index after China’s exchange rate system reform on the 21st July 2005. After dividing the time series into two parts according to the change in the yuan exchange rate regime in July 2008, we compare the statistical properties of the yuan exchange rate index during these two periods. We find that the distribution of the two return series has the exponential form. We also perform the detrending moving average analysis (DMA) and the multifractal detrending moving average analysis (MFDMA). The two periods possess different degrees of long-range correlations, and the multifractal nature is also unveiled in these two time series. Significant difference is found in the scaling exponents tau(q) and singularity spectra f(alpha) of the two periods obtained from the MFDMA analysis. Besides, in order to detect the sources of multifractality, shuffling and phase randomization procedures are applied to destroy the long-range temporal correlation and fat-tailed distribution of the yuan exchange rate index respectively. We find that the fat-tailedness plays a critical role in the sources of multifractality in the first period, while the long memory is the major cause in the second period. The results suggest that the change in China’s exchange rate regime in July 2008 gives rise to the different multifractal properties of the yuan exchange rate index in these two periods, and thus has an effect on the effective exchange rate of the yuan after the exchange rate reform on the 21st July 2005.},

The study is based on the non-Gaussian texture analysis of the polarimetric airborne Pi-SAR data over coniferous forests in Hokkaido, Japan. The radar cross section (RCS) in terms of a forest biomass is first analyzed. It is found that the L-band RCS increases steadily with the biomass and saturates at approximately 40 tons/ha. These results are similar to the previous studies. The probability density function of the image amplitude is then investigated, and among Rayleigh, log-normal, Weibull, and K-distributions, the K-distribution is found to fit best to the L-band data of all polarizations, although the Weibull distribution fits equally well. Further, the correlation between the tree biomass and the order parameter of the K-distribution in the cross-polarization images is found to be very high, and the order parameter increases consistently with the biomass to approximately 100 tons/ha, which is well beyond the saturation limit of the L-band RCS. Thus, the order parameter of the K-distribution can be a promising new parameter to estimate the forest biomass from high-resolution polarimetric SAR data in a much wider range than the conventional RCS method},

However, they may fail to delineate objects of interest depicted on images with intensity inhomogeneity. To resolve this issue, a novel image feature, termed as local edge entropy, is proposed in this study to reduce the negative impact of inhomogeneity on image segmentation. An active contour model is developed on the basis of this feature, where an edge entropy fitting (EEF) energy is defined with the combination of a redesigned regularization term. Minimizing the energy in a variational level set formulation can successfully drive the motion of an initial contour curve towards optimal object boundaries. Experiments on a number of test images demonstrate that the proposed model has the capability of handling intensity inhomogeneity with reasonable segmentation accuracy.},

This motivates us to construct nearly unbiased estimators for the unknown parameters. We adopt a “corrective” approach to derive modified MLEs that are bias-free to second order. We also consider an alternative bias-correction mechanism based on Efron’s bootstrap resampling. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to compare the performance between the proposed and two previous methods in the literature. The numerical evidence shows that the bias-corrected estimators are extremely accurate even for very small sample sizes and are superior than the previous estimators in terms of biases and root mean squared errors. Finally, applications to two real datasets are presented for illustrative purposes.},

The results from the multifractal detrending moving average algorithm show that twelve exchange rate series were multifractal. The major source of multifractality are long-range correlations of small and large fluctuations. Fat-tail distributions have important effects on the multifractality of USD/AUR, USD/EUR and CNY/USD exchange rates. We also find evidence that extreme events play an important role in the contributions to multifractality for the USD/EUR exchange rate.},

Correlations between the derived sigmaHH 0, sigmaHV 0, and sigmaVV 0 and the biophysical parameters are investigated and yield the following results. 1) The above-ground biomass-sigma0 curves saturate above 50 tons/ha for sigmaVV 0, 100 tons/ha for sigmaHH 0, and over 100 tons/ha for sigmaHV 0 when all forest species are included in the curves. 2) The sigmaHH 0-above-ground biomass curve for one forest species indicates a higher saturation level than that for the other forest species. Dependence on the forest species was absent for VV polarization and low for HV polarization. 3) A simple three-component scattering model indicates that volume scattering accounts for 80%-90% when the above-ground biomass exceeds 50 tons/ha. The surface-scattering components are up to ~20% for young stands, and the volume-scattering components are down to 70%. The origin of the dependency among the forest species was examined for the sigmaHH 0-above-ground biomass. It is concluded that a possible cause of the dependency is the different characteristics of the stands rather than forest species},

For a one-parameter exponential family the log likelihood is the same as the quasi-likelihood and it follows that assuming a one-parameter exponential family is the weakest sort of distributional assumption that can be made. The Gauss-Newton method for calculating nonlinear least squares estimates generalizes easily to deal with maximum quasi-likelihood estimates, and a rearrangement of this produces a generalization of the method described by Nelder & Wedderburn (1972).},

They provide valuable insight into the pathological mechanisms of depression. However, few reports were involved in the “long-term memory” of fMRI signals. This study was to investigate the “long-term memory” of resting-state networks by calculating their Hurst exponents for identifying depressed patients from healthy controls. Resting-state networks were extracted from fMRI data of 20 MDD and 20 matched healthy control subjects. The Hurst exponent of each network was estimated by Range Scale analysis for further discriminant analysis. 95% of depressed patients and 85% of healthy controls were correctly classified by Support Vector Machine with an accuracy of 90%. The right fronto-parietal and default mode network constructed a deficit network (lower memory and more irregularity in MDD), while the left fronto-parietal, ventromedial prefrontal and salience network belonged to an excess network (longer memory in MDD), suggesting these dysfunctional networks may be related to a portion of the complex of emotional and cognitive disturbances. The abnormal “long-term memory” of resting-state networks associated with depression may provide a new possibility towards the exploration of the pathophysiological mechanisms of MDD.},

  abstract  = {The aim of this study was to detect and compare the changes in the time–frequency and fractal scaling behaviors of heart rate (HR) and respiratory frequency (Rf), recorded simultaneously during a high altitude mountain ascent. The time–frequency analysis was performed using the local cosine4 orthonormal bases of Coifman, Malvar and Meyer, whose spectrum is not redundant as those computed with the short Fourier transform. The fractal scaling behavior was obtained using the detrended fluctuation (DFA) and the wavelet leaders (WL) analysis. Results showed that the high altitude mountain ascent differently affected HR and Rf variability. Rf average values increased (p=0.0003) while HR average values did not change. The scaling variability of HR was altered during the mountain ascent, which was detected by the increasing HR short range DFA exponents with altitude (p<0.03). Rf scaling variability remained unchanged. These differences between HR and Rf alterations were also observed for the local cosine4 power law behavior since power law exponents, in absolute values, increased for HR (p<0.003) while those of Rf did not change. Furthermore, the ratio of low over the whole local spectrum energy of Rf decreased with altitude (p=0.04) in contrast to HR. in most of these HR and Rf analyses, one of the two time series was significantly modified but not both. Moreover, the Rf local cosine4 spectrum had higher entropy compared to HR (p<0.01), the difference between the Rf and the HR entropy increased (p=0.04) during the mountain ascent. in consequence, Rf had more randomness than HR and altitude increased this difference.},

  abstract  = {Scale invariance, the property relating time series across multiple scales, has provided a new perspective of physiological phenomena and their underlying control systems. The traditional “signal plus noise” paradigm of the engineer was first replaced with a model in which biological time series have a fractal structure in time (Fractal Physiology, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1994). This new paradigm was subsequently shown to be overly restrictive when certain physiological signals were found to be characterized by more than one scaling parameter and therefore to belong to a class of more complex processes known as multifractals (Fractals, Plenum Press, New York, 1988). Here we demonstrate that in addition to heart rate (Nature 399 (1999) 461) and human gait (Phys. Rev. E, submitted for publication), the nonlinear control system for cerebral blood flow (CBF) (Phys. Rev. Lett., submitted for publication; Phys. Rev. E 59 (1999) 3492) is multifractal. We also find that this multifractality is greatly reduced for subjects with “serious” migraine and we present a simple model for the underlying control process to describe this effect.},

I model unobserved structural change through time variation in the natural rates of interest and unemployment. I show that certainty equivalent optimal policies perform poorly when there is model uncertainty about the natural rate processes. I then examine the properties of combined estimation methods and policy rules that are robust to this type of model uncertainty. I find that weighted averages of sample means perform well as estimators of natural rates. The optimal policy under uncertainty responds more aggressively to inflation and less so to the perceived unemployment gap than the certainty equivalent policy. This robust estimation/policy combination is highly effective at mitigating the effects of natural rate mismeasurement.},

Our study is based on an empirical investigation reported in Teverovsky, Taqqu and Willinger [33] of the modified rescaled adjusted range or R/S statistic that was proposed by Lo [17] as a test for long-range dependence with good robustness properties under “extra” short-range dependence. Our main conclusion is that because the modified R/S statistic shows a strong preference for accepting the null hypothesis of no long-range dependence, irrespective of whether long-range dependence is present in the data or not, Lo's acceptance of the hypothesis for the CRSP data (i.e., no long-range dependence in stock market prices) is less conclusive than is usually regarded in the econometrics literature. in fact, upon further analysis of the data, we find empirical evidence of long-range dependence in stock price returns, but because the corresponding degree of long-range dependence (measured via the Hurst parameter H) is typically very low (i.e., H-values around 0.60), the evidence is not absolutely conclusive.},

We develop a simple model when agents differ in their ability to process information, which turns out to be enough to generate persistence upon aggregation.

  abstract    = {The Indian stock market is one of the earliest in Asia being in operation since 1875, but remained largely outside the global integration process until the late 1980s. A number of developing countries in concert with the International Finance Corporation and the World Bank took steps in the 1980s to establish and revitalize their stock markets as an effective way of mobilizing and allocation of finance. in line with the global trend, reform of the Indian stock market began with the establishment of Securities and Exchange Board of India in 1988. This paper empirically investigates the long-run equilibrium relationship and short-run dynamic linkage between the Indian stock market and the stock markets in major developed countries (United States, United Kingdom and Japan) after 1990 by examining the Granger causality relationship and the pairwise, multiple and fractional cointegrations between the Indian stock market and the stock markets from these three developed markets. We conclude that Indian stock market is integrated with mature markets and sensitive to the dynamics in these markets in a long run. in a short run, both US and Japan Granger causes the Indian stock market but not vice versa. in addition, we find that the Indian stock index and the mature stock indices form fractionally cointegrated relationship in the long run with a common fractional, nonstationary component and find that the Johansen method is the best reveal their cointegration relationship.},

  abstract      = {As one classic technique of computer vision, image retrieval could retrieve the target images from hundreds of thousands of images effectively. Furthermore, with the rapid development of deep learning, the quality of retrieval is increased obviously. However, under normal conditions, the high-quality retrieval is supported by a large number of learning instances. The large number of learning instances not only need much human source in the process of selection, but also need much computing source in the process of computation. More importantly, for some special categories, it’s difficult to obtain a large number of learning instances. Aiming at the problem above, we proposed one joint entropy based learning model which could reduce the number of learning instances through optimizing the distribution of learning instances. Firstly, the learning instances are pre-selected using improved watershed segmentation method. Then, joint entropy model is used for reducing the possibility of double, useless even mistaken instances existence. After that, a database using a large number of images is built up. Sufficient experiments based on the database show the model’s superiority that our model not only could reduce the number of learning instances but also could keep the accuracy of retrieval.},

  abstract    = {Energy markets and the associated energy futures markets play a crucial role in global economies. We investigate the statistical properties of the recurrence intervals of daily volatility time series of four NYMEX energy futures, which are defined as the waiting times $\tau$ between consecutive volatilities exceeding a given threshold $q$. We find that the recurrence intervals are distributed as a stretched exponential $P_q(\tau)\sim e^{(a\tau)^{-\gamma}}$, where the exponent $\gamma$ decreases with increasing $q$, and there is no scaling behavior in the distributions for different thresholds $q$ after the recurrence intervals are scaled with the mean recurrence interval $\bar\tau$. These findings are significant under the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the Cram{\'e}r-von Mises test. We show that empirical estimations are in nice agreement with the numerical integration results for the occurrence probability $W_q(\Delta{t}|t)$ of a next event above the threshold $q$ within a (short) time interval after an elapsed time $t$ from the last event above $q$. We also investigate the memory effects of the recurrence intervals. It is found that the conditional distributions of large and small recurrence intervals differ from each other and the conditional mean of the recurrence intervals scales as a power law of the preceding interval $\bar\tau(\tau_0)/\bar\tau \sim (\tau_0/\bar\tau)^\beta$, indicating that the recurrence intervals have short-term correlations. Detrended fluctuation analysis and detrending moving average analysis further uncover that the recurrence intervals possess long-term correlations. We confirm that the \&quot;clustering\&quot; of the volatility recurrence intervals is caused by the long-term correlations well known to be present in the volatility.},

The result showed that, if doing so, much useful information of time series would be lost. The forecast formula of ARFIMA model was corrected according to the method of fractional differencing, and was employed in the empirical study. It was illustrated that the forecast performance of ARFIMA model was not as good as we expected since the ARFIMA model was ineffective in forecasting Hang Sheng index.

Given the increasing availability of SAR satellite data, the synergized use of optical and SAR data is increasingly important. However, previous studies have focused primarily on a single scale. This study aims to evaluate the impervious surfaces estimation using different combinations of optical and SAR data, as well as to quantify the scale effects of combining optical and SAR data under various resolutions from 30 to 1050 m. Six combinations of optical and SAR data in three cities, Shenzhen, Mumbai, and São Paulo, were compared. Experimental results illustrated the effectiveness of using texture and SAR data in improving impervious surface estimation with producer's accuracy improvement of 5%, 0%, and 4% in Shenzhen, Mumbai, and São Paulo at 30 m. The correlation coefficient assessment between the estimated and referenced impervious surfaces at various scales demonstrated that TerraSAR-X data generally outperformed ENVISAT advanced SAR of impervious surface estimation. Estimation accuracy of impervious surfaces in Shenzhen had an improvement of 4% to 5%. Moreover, the texture information of SAR data was observed to provide positive contributions to the impervious surfaces estimation in three study cases at different scales.},

From other considerations, he has generalized [4] a result of Feller [1] that arbitrary (and hence finite) mixtures of Poisson distributions are identifiable, and has also shown binomial and uniform families do not generate identifiable mixtures. In this paper it is proven that a family F of cumulative distribution functions (cdf's) induces identifiable finite mixtures if and only if F is linearly independent in its span over the field of real numbers. Also we demonstrate that finite mixtures of F are identifiable if F is any of the following: the family of n products of exponential distributions, the multivariate Gaussian family, the union of the last two families, the family of one-dimensional Cauchy distributions, and the non-degenerate members of the family of one-dimensional negative binomial distributions. Finally it is shown that the translation-parameter family generated by any one-dimensional cdf yields identifiable finite mixtures.},

Power comparisons of these eight tests were obtained via the Monte Carlo simulation of sample data generated from alternative distributions that follow symmetric short-tailed, symmetric long-tailed and asymmetric distributions. Our simulation results show that for symmetric short-tailed distributions, D'Agostino and Shapiro–Wilk tests have better power. For symmetric long-tailed distributions, the power of Jarque–Bera and D'Agostino tests is quite comparable with the Shapiro–Wilk test. As for asymmetric distributions, the Shapiro–Wilk test is the most powerful test followed by the Anderson–Darling test.},

This particular skewed distribution that can be used quite effectively in analyzing lifetime data. It is observed that the new distribution has modified unimodal hazard function. Various properties of the new Burr distribution, such that moments, quantile functions, hazard function, and Shannon's entropy are obtained. The exact form of the probability density function and moments of {\$}{\$}i{{}{\backslash}mathrm{{}th{}}{}}{\$}{\$} i th -order statistics in a sample of size n from new Burr distribution are derived. Estimation of parameters and change-point of hazard function by the maximum likelihood method are discussed.

  abstract      = {A new image segmentation method based on finite truncated Gaussian mixture model has been proposed. The truncated Gaussian distribution includes several of the skewed and asymmetric distributions as particular cases with a finite range. It also includes the Gaussian distribution as a limiting case. We used the Estimation Maximization algorithm to estimate the model parameters of the image data and the number of mixture components was estimated using hierarchical clustering algorithm. This algorithm was also utilized for developing the initial estimates of the EM algorithm. Segmentation was carried out by clustering each pixel into the appropriate component according to the maximum likelihood estimation criteria. The advantage of our method lies in its efficiency on initialization of the model parameters and segmenting images in a totally unsupervised manner. Experimental results show that this segmentation method can provide better results than the other methods.},

The positive relation between these moments and the order of integration suggests that the degree of fractional integration should decrease with a lower mean or variance.

  abstract      = {The fuzzy c-partition entropy has been widely adopted as a global optimization technique for finding the optimal thresholds when performing multilevel gray image segmentation. Nevertheless, existing fuzzy c-partition entropy approaches generally have two limitations, i.e., partition number c needs to be manually tuned for different input and the methods can process grayscale images only. To address these two limitations, an unsupervised multilevel segmentation algorithm is presented in this paper. The core step of our algorithm is a bi-level segmentation operator, which uses binary graph cuts to maximize both fuzzy 2-partition entropy and segmentation smoothness. By iteratively performing this bi-level segmentation operator, multilevel image segmentation is achieved in a hierarchical manner: Starting from the input color image, our algorithm first picks the color channel that can best segment the image into two labels, and then iteratively selects channels to further split each labels until convergence. The experimental results demonstrate the presented hierarchical segmentation scheme can efficiently segment both grayscale and color images. Quantitative evaluations over classic gray images and the Berkeley Segmentation Database show that our method is comparable to the state-of-the-art multi-scale segmentation methods, yet has the advantage of being unsupervised, efficient, and easy to implement.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Two lifetime distributions derived from Perks’ mortality rate function, one with 4 parameters and the other with 5 parameters, for the modeling of bathtub-shaped failure rates are proposed in this paper. The Perks’ mortality/failure rate functions have historically been used for human life modeling in life insurance industry. Although this distribution is no longer used in insurance industry, considering many nice and some unique features of this function, it is necessary to revisit it and introduce it to the reliability community. The parameters of the distributions can control the scale, shape, and location of the PDF. The 4-parameter distribution can be used to model the bathtub failure rate. This model is applied to three previously published groups of lifetime data. This study shows they fit very well. The 5-parameter version can potentially model constant hazard rates of the later life of some devices in addition to the good features of 4-parameter version. Both the 4 and 5-parameter versions have closed form PDF and CDF. The truncated distributions of both versions stay within the original distribution family with simple parameter transformation. This nice feature is normally considered to be only possessed by the simple exponential distribution },

We find that the CSI 300 is featured by multifractality and there are less complexity and risk after the CSI 300 index future was introduced. With the shuffling, surrogating and removing extreme values procedures, we unveil that extreme events and fat-distribution are the main origin of multifractality. Besides, we discuss the knotting phenomena in multifractality, and find that the scaling range and the irregular fluctuations for large scales in the Fq(s) vs s plot can cause a knot.},

Although the MSMD process is exponential $\beta$-mixing as we show in the paper, it is capable of generating highly persistent autocorrelation. We study analytically and by simulation how this feature of durations generated by the MSMD process propagates to counts and realized volatility. We employ a quasi-maximum likelihood estimator of the MSMD parameters based on the Whittle approximation and establish its strong consistency and asymptotic normality for general MSMD specifications. We show that the Whittle estimation is a computationally simple and fast alternative to maximum likelihood. Finally, we compare the performance of the MSMD model with competing short- and long-memory duration models in an out-of-sample forecasting exercise based on price durations of three major foreign exchange futures contracts. The results of the comparison show that the MSMD and LMSD perform similarly and are superior to the short-memory ACD models.},

The Burr XII distribution gives the reliability practitioner another model for representing failure data. in this paper, the statistical and probablistic properties of the Burr XII distribution are presented, and its relationship to other distributions used in reliability analyses is described. Itsuse as a model for failure data is outlined, methods for graphical estimation on probability paper are illustrated, and examples of its usage are presented.},

This family of distributions possesses great flexibility while fitting symmetric as well as skewed models with varying tail weights. in a similar vein, we define here a family of univariate distributions generated by Stacy’s generalized gamma variables. For these two families of univariate distributions, we discuss maximum entropy characterizations under suitable constraints. Based on these characterizations, an expected ratio of quantile densities is proposed for the discrimination of members of these two broad families of distributions. Several special cases of these results are then highlighted. An alternative to the usual method of moments is also proposed for the estimation of the parameters, and the form of these estimators is particularly amenable to these two families of distributions.},

Long-range dependence is present, and thus the celebrated Brownian motion of prices can be considered only as a first approximation. in this work we analyzed the predictability in commodity markets by using a novel approach derived from Information Theory. The complexity–entropy causality plane has been recently shown to be a useful statistical tool to distinguish the stage of stock market development because differences between emergent and developed stock markets can be easily discriminated and visualized with this representation space [L. Zunino, M. Zanin, B.M. Tabak, D.G. P\'erez, O.A. Rosso, Complexity–entropy causality plane: a useful approach to quantify the stock market inefficiency, Physica A 389 (2010) 1891–1901]. By estimating the permutation entropy and permutation statistical complexity of twenty basic commodity future markets over a period of around 20 years (1991.01.02–2009.09.01), we can define an associated ranking of efficiency. This ranking is quantifying the presence of patterns and hidden structures in these prime markets. Moreover, the temporal evolution of the commodities in the complexity–entropy causality plane allows us to identify periods of time where the underlying dynamics is more or less predictable.},

  abstract  = {In the recent past, technology has advanced significantly to promote e-learning as an effective learning tool. Where physical facilities are lacking due to resource constraints, e-learning may be utilized as a complement to physical labs. Further, smartphone-based Android technology has accelerated the extension of laptop-based e-learning for implementation on smartphones and tablets. This paper presents the development and implementation of the Black Scholes Pricing Models on Android smartphone and tablet. The paper begins with a brief description of the classic Black Scholes mathematical models for pricing derivatives such as call and put options. Three different methods of approximations are adopted to solve the Black Scholes models, namely the analytical, the numerical and the Binomial Tree methods. For each method, the algorithms are implemented on Android operating system. A sample demonstration of these Android smartphone app simulations is given to illustrate the implementation methodology and run-time steps. The simulated results among the three different methods are compared. Simulation results indicate correct implementation of the three methods for the Black Scholes model on smartphones. Further development is on-going to fully utilize Android smartphone app for pricing financial derivatives.},

The twin SVM formulation is in the spirit of proximal SVMs via generalized eigenvalues. On several benchmark data sets, Twin SVM is not only fast, but shows good generalization. Twin SVM is also useful for automatically discovering two-dimensional projections of the data},

  abstract  = {This paper deals with a Two-Echelon Fixed Fleet Heterogeneous Vehicle Routing Problem (2E-HVRP) faced by Brazilian wholesale companies. Vehicle routing problems with more than one phase are known as Multi-Echelon VRP and consider situations in which freight is moved through some intermediate facilities (e.g., cross-docks or distribution centers) before reaching its destination. The first phase of the problem dealt here is to choose a first-level vehicle, from an heterogeneous set, that will leave a depot and reach an intermediate uncapacitated facility (satellite) to serve a set of second-level vehicles. After that, it is necessary to define routes for smaller vehicles, also from an heterogeneous set, that will visit a set of customers departing from and returning to a satellite. The solution proposed here is an efficient island based memetic algorithm with a local search procedure based on Lin–Kernighan heuristic (IBMA-LK). In order to attest the algorithm’s efficiency, first it was tested in single echelon HVRP benchmark instances. After that the instances were adapted for two-echelon context and used for 2E-HVRP validation and, finally, it was tested on 2E-HVRP instances created using real world normalized data. Localsolver tool was also executed for comparison purposes. Promising results (which corroborate results obtained on the real problem) and future works are presented and discussed.},

For nonlinear kernel classifiers, the method utilizes a minimal number of kernel functions in the classifier that it generates.},

  abstract  = {With the development of clinical technologies, different tumor features have been collected for breast cancer diagnosis. Filtering all the pertinent feature information to support the clinical disease diagnosis is a challenging and time consuming task. The objective of this research is to diagnose breast cancer based on the extracted tumor features. Feature extraction and selection are critical to the quality of classifiers founded through data mining methods. To extract useful information and diagnose the tumor, a hybrid of K-means and support vector machine (K-SVM) algorithms is developed. The K-means algorithm is utilized to recognize the hidden patterns of the benign and malignant tumors separately. The membership of each tumor to these patterns is calculated and treated as a new feature in the training model. Then, a support vector machine (SVM) is used to obtain the new classifier to differentiate the incoming tumors. Based on 10-fold cross validation, the proposed methodology improves the accuracy to 97.38%, when tested on the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) data set from the University of California – Irvine machine learning repository. Six abstract tumor features are extracted from the 32 original features for the training phase. The results not only illustrate the capability of the proposed approach on breast cancer diagnosis, but also shows time savings during the training phase. Physicians can also benefit from the mined abstract tumor features by better understanding the properties of different types of tumors.},

  volume    = {71},
  year      = {2014},
  abstract  = {Twin support vector classification (TSVM) finds two nonparallel hyper-planes by solving a pair of smaller-sized quadratic programming problems (QPPs) rather than a single large one as in the classical support vector machine (SVM), which makes the learning speed of TSVM approximately four times faster than that of the standard SVM. However the same penalties are given to the samples, which reduces the classification accuracy of TSVM. To improve the classification accuracy, rough ν-TSVM was proposed, where different penalties are given to the negative samples depending on their different positions when constructing separating hyper-plane for the positive samples. But the local information of positive samples is not exploited, and each positive sample shares the same weights in it. In fact, they have different effects on the separating hyper-planes. Inspired by the studies above, we propose a K-nearest neighbor (KNN)-based weighted rough ν-twin support vector machine (Weighted rough ν-TSVM) in this paper, in which not only different penalties are given to one class of samples, but also different weights are given to the other class of samples. So weighted rough ν-TSVM yields higher testing accuracy in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, weighted rough ν-TSVM costs lower than other algorithms since some redundant constraints are deleted. In addition, the influence of different number K of clusters is also discussed in this paper. Numerical experiments on forty-two benchmark datasets are performed to investigate the validity of our proposed algorithm. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.},

  abstract      = {Twin K-class support vector classification (Twin-KSVC) is a novel multi-class method based on twin support vector machine (TWSVM). In this paper, we formulate a least squares version of Twin-KSVC called as LST-KSVC. This formulation leads to extremely simple and fast algorithm. LST-KSVC, same as the Twin-KSVC, evaluates all the training data into a “1-versus-1-versus-rest” structure, so it generates ternary output {−1, 0, +1}. In LST-KSVC, the solution of the two modified primal problems is reduced to solving only two systems of linear equations whereas Twin-KSVC needs to solve two quadratic programming problems (QPPs) along with two systems of linear equations. Our experiments on UCI and face datasets indicate that the proposed method has comparable accuracy in classification to that of Twin-KSVC but with remarkably less computational time. Also, because of the structure “1-versus-1-versus-rest”, the classification accuracy of LST-KSVC is higher than typical multi-class method based on SVMs.},

  abstract      = {In this survey, we review work in machine learning on methods for handling data sets containing large amounts of irrelevant information. We focus on two key issues: the problem of selecting relevant features, and the problem of selecting relevant examples. We describe the advances that have been made on these topics in both empirical and theoretical work in machine learning, and we present a general framework that we use to compare different methods. We close with some challenges for future work in this area.},

  abstract  = {In the paper, the inverse Nakagami-m (NK) distribution is proposed. This distribution is the reciprocal of the NK model that plays an important role in the general area of the communications engineering and reliability system. The proposed model is useful to describe devices that are subjected to high stress, providing high failure rate after a short repair time. An account of mathematical properties is presented such as the rth moment, mean, variance, rth central moment, survival properties, and Shannon's entropy. The maximum-likelihood estimators are explored under complete and censored data, but a bias correction was applied to the order O(n-2) for obtaining nearly unbiased performance. An efficient closed-form maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator was also proposed. A simulation study compares the performance of the estimators with a clear advantage for the closed-form MAP one. Finally, we illustrate the new distribution fitting on three real datasets.},

His aimwas to point out theways in which his views on coefficient alpha had evolved, doubting nowthat the coefficientwas the bestway of judging the reliability of an instrument to which it was applied. Tracing in these notes, in vintage Cronbach style, his thinking before, during, and after the publication of the alpha paper, his “current thoughts” on coefficient alpha are that alpha covers only a small perspective of the range of measurement uses for which reliability information is needed and that it should be viewed within a much larger system of reliability analysis, generalizability theory.},

  abstract  = {Various applications in natural science require models more accurate than well-known distributions. In this context, several generators of distributions have been recently proposed. We introduce a new four-parameter extended normal (EN) distribution, which can provide better fits than the skew-normal and beta normal distributions as proved empirically in two applications to real data. We present Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the effectiveness of the EN distribution using the Kullback-Leibler divergence criterion. The classical regression model is not recommended for most practical applications because it oversimplifies real world problems. We propose an EN regression model and show its usefulness in practice by comparing with other regression models. We adopt maximum likelihood method for estimating the model parameters of both proposed distribution and regression model.},
